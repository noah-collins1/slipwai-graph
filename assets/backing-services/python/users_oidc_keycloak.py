"""PLACEHOLDER — this is NOT a working token validator.

Selecting Keycloak for the product's own users wires a second realm, `customers`, into the
same Keycloak container as the staff realm `app`, plus the environment variables that name it.
The token validation is deliberately not written here.

The browser app performs the login — Authorization Code flow with PKCE, through
react-oidc-context — and sends the access token as a bearer token. This service is a resource
server for the `customers` realm: it validates that token on every request before trusting a
byte of it. Before implementing, load `skills/secure-oauth-oidc/SKILL.md` — it covers what this
module must get right and what silently breaks if it does not:

  - Signature against the issuer's JWKS, found through the discovery document at
    `USERS_OIDC_ISSUER`.
  - `exp`: an expired token is one somebody may have lost.
  - `aud` containing `USERS_OIDC_AUDIENCE`, so a token minted for another client is not
    accepted here.
  - `iss` exactly `USERS_OIDC_ISSUER`. See the mix-up hazard below.

Use a maintained JWT/JWKS library rather than hand-rolling these checks.

What this module owns: turning a validated token's claims into a `Customer` the domain can key
on, in `customer_from_claims`. It is pure, so it is testable without a provider, and it is the
one place these rules live:

  - `iss` must be exactly the expected issuer.
  - `sub` must be present. It is the only stable key a customer has; email addresses change.
  - `email_verified` must be exactly true, because an unverified address is one anybody can
    type.

What this module does not own: customers have no groups and no roles. Whether a customer may
see an order is a question of ownership or tenancy, and it is decided in the use case that
loads the order, against the `Customer` it is handed — not here, and not by anything in the
token.

The mix-up hazard worth knowing about now: both realms live in one Keycloak, so a staff token
is a perfectly valid JWT, signed by the same server, whose issuer differs from a customer's by
one path segment: `/realms/app` against `/realms/customers`. A resource server that checks the
signature but not the issuer would accept a staff member as a customer. `customer_from_claims`
refuses any issuer that is not exactly the expected one, and its test uses the staff realm's
issuer on purpose. A staff token must never pass as a customer.

The realm fixture is `docker/keycloak/realms/customers.json`; the staff one is
`docker/keycloak/realms/app.json`. Locally the issuer is
`http://localhost:8081/realms/customers` and the audience `api`; both are set in
`.env.example`.
