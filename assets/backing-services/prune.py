"""Prune this project's backing services down to the ones it actually uses.

This file has two lives, deliberately from one copy. The factory imports it to cut a generated project down
to what was selected at generation time, and the generated project carries it as
`scripts/backing-services.py` so `./init` can cut it down further. A second implementation of the same
pruning would be a second set of bugs.

Every question is asked as an **axis** — the role being filled — rather than as a product name:

    scripts/backing-services.py --list
    scripts/backing-services.py --event-store memory     # drop the real store, keep the in-memory one
    scripts/backing-services.py --http none              # drop the inbound HTTP transport
    scripts/backing-services.py --auth none              # drop the staff realm and its adapter
    scripts/backing-services.py --users none             # drop the customers realm, the browser login and its adapter

An axis offers only what is still on disk. A project generated with SQLite can drop to memory but cannot
become a Postgres project: pruning only ever subtracts, and the factory already cut the branch it was not
asked for. `--list` shows what each axis can still be answered with in *this* project.

Naming a selection is a one-way prune: it deletes files and strips the markers. Nothing is committed, so
`git checkout .` before your first commit undoes it.

Regions inside a shared file are delimited by `backing-service:<feature>:begin` / `:end` marker comments
rather than parsed out of each host language. A region two features both need — the one Keycloak container
that serves the staff realm and the customers realm — names both, `backing-service:keycloak|users-keycloak`,
and stays while either remains. That is not laziness: pruning Compose YAML by indentation
looks easy and is not — a two-space key means different things in different sections, `  postgres-data:`
under `volumes:` looks exactly like `  postgres:` under `services:`, and treating it as a service leaves
`volumes:` with nothing under it, which Compose rejects outright. A marker says what the author meant, in
every file, and the author is the only one who knows.

# Every language family this script knows the layout of. Families rather than backends, because
# `project_services` reads each service's `language` from `project.json`, and every table keyed by it
# below is keyed that way too — per service, since a project's services need not share a language.
#
# Java now has two frameworks, and they turned out to agree about almost all of this: the same marked
# files, the same source layout, the same empty `PACKAGE_EDITS` (their dependencies live in marked pom
# regions, so there is nothing for a package manager to uninstall). They disagree in exactly one place —
# which registration file the datasource configuration is found through — and that is handled by naming
# both paths where they appear, since a prune of a path this project does not have is a no-op. A family
# whose members disagreed about something a no-op could not cover would rekey the table that differs to
# `project.json`'s `backend`, which the factory already writes beside `language`; nothing needs that yet.
# The factory asserts this tuple against its catalog.
LANGUAGES = ("typescript", "python", "go", "java")

# The axes, and which features each answer keeps. An option is offerable in a given project only when every
# feature it needs is still on disk, which is what makes "you may drop to memory, you may not upgrade to
# Postgres" fall out of the data rather than out of a special case.
#
# `notes` is the consequence of the answer, printed when it is chosen and by `--list`. It is prose rather
# than a doc link on purpose: the moment somebody drops the real event store is the moment they need to be
# told what stopped being provable.
#
# `targets` is where an option is offered — the production targets, as `project.json` records this
# project's under `target`. The factory filtered the menu by it at generation time and this script filters
# the same way afterwards, so an answer a project's target cannot carry is refused here too rather than
# pruned into. SQLite is local-only (the file dies with the task), Keycloak is local-only (Cognito is its
# answer in the cloud), and Cognito is offered under `aws` alone.
#
# `capabilities` is what the answer gives the project — the same list `catalog.json` declares on the option
# and the generator writes into `project.json` per deployable, which is why `record_answers` can swap one
# for another rather than recomputing a project's capabilities from a second copy of the rules. Mirrored
# like `features` and `targets`, and the factory asserts the three agree with the catalog.
