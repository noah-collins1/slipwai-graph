// Package userskeycloak is a PLACEHOLDER — it is NOT a working token validator.
//
// Selecting Keycloak for the product's own users wires a second realm, customers, into the same
// Keycloak container as the staff realm app, plus the environment variables that name it. The
// token validation is deliberately not written here.
//
// The browser app performs the login — Authorization Code flow with PKCE, through
// react-oidc-context — and sends the access token as a bearer token. This service is a resource
// server for the customers realm: it validates that token on every request before trusting a
// byte of it. Before implementing, load skills/secure-oauth-oidc/SKILL.md — it covers what this
// package must get right and what silently breaks if it does not:
//
//   - Signature against the issuer's JWKS, found through the discovery document at
//     USERS_OIDC_ISSUER.
//   - exp: an expired token is one somebody may have lost.
//   - aud containing USERS_OIDC_AUDIENCE, so a token minted for another client is not accepted
//     here.
//   - iss exactly USERS_OIDC_ISSUER. See the mix-up hazard below.
//
// Use a maintained JWT/JWKS library rather than hand-rolling these checks.
//
// What this package owns: turning a validated token's claims into a Customer the domain can key
// on, in CustomerFromClaims. It is pure, so it is testable without a provider, and it is the one
// place these rules live:
//
//   - iss must be exactly the expected issuer.
//   - sub must be present. It is the only stable key a customer has; email addresses change.
//   - email_verified must be exactly true, because an unverified address is one anybody can type.
//
// What this package does not own: customers have no groups and no roles. Whether a customer may
// see an order is a question of ownership or tenancy, and it is decided in the use case that
// loads the order, against the Customer it is handed — not here, and not by anything in the
// token.
//
// The mix-up hazard worth knowing about now: both realms live in one Keycloak, so a staff token
// is a perfectly valid JWT, signed by the same server, whose issuer differs from a customer's by
// one path segment: /realms/app against /realms/customers. A resource server that checks the
// signature but not the issuer would accept a staff member as a customer. CustomerFromClaims
// refuses any issuer that is not exactly the expected one, and its test uses the staff realm's
// issuer on purpose. A staff token must never pass as a customer.
//
// The realm fixture is docker/keycloak/realms/customers.json; the staff one is
// docker/keycloak/realms/app.json. Locally the issuer is http://localhost:8081/realms/customers
// and the audience api; both are set in .env.example.
