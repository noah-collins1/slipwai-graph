"""Hold a slice branch to the files one slice may touch — the shared-surface rule, held mechanically.

Once the event contract is settled, ready slices run concurrently: one delegate per slice, each on a
`slice/<id>` branch in its own worktree, merged back in split order (`commands/drive.md`, *Running ready
slices concurrently*). That works only because the files two slices could fight over are few and named.
This is the list, and the gate on it. On a branch that is not `slice/<id>` there is nothing to hold, and the
script says so and exits 0 — which is why `make verify` runs it everywhere.

What a slice's change may contain — everything since the branch left `main`, committed or not:

- **its own record**, `specs/<feature>/slices/<id>/**`, and the feature's cumulative artifacts — `spec.md`,
  `story-split.md`, `contracts/`, `checklists/`, `adversary-log.md`, `decisions.md`, `slices/README.md` — which
  every slice amends and the host merges in split order. `decisions.md` is among them because `/cruise` writes
  a decision where the ladder took it, which during a slice's stages is the slice's branch, and `check-decisions`
  wants every `Written to` path in the tree, which for a slice's artifacts is only true there;
- **its own block of `docs/event-model/model.yaml`**: every other slice's block reads exactly as on `main`.
  Events, commands and read models are frames inside a slice's block, so the contract another slice builds
  against cannot move underneath it; `docs/event-model/mockups/` is per screen and open;
- **the committed canvas, `docs/event-model/model.drawio`**, because it is rendered from the model the slice
  just changed and `check-drawio` fails the branch until it is: that gate holds it to `model.yaml`, so it can
  carry nothing of the slice's own. The host regenerates it again after each merge;
- **a new ADR under `docs/adr/`**: a decision taken during the slice whose reversal would be a migration is
  written there at `Proposed`, by `/cruise` or by the slice's own planning. New files only — an ADR that exists
  is never edited; superseding one is the host's, on `main`;
- **code and tests of the service that owns it** — `service` in its model block, or any service where the
  model names none — and, where the block names a `context`, nothing under another context's directory in
  `domain/` or `application/`. A browser app is open to every slice: a white box is one screen. A deployable
  recorded at `.` — an adopted repository's one application — owns every path no other deployable claims, its
  tests and sibling directories included, except the host's surface: `project.json`, the root `Makefile`,
  `.specify/`, CI configuration (`.github/` and its forge siblings, and `ci.gate`), harness guidance
  (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/` and the other agents' directories), the delivery directory less
  `survey/pinned.md` and `survey/running.md`, and every path in `<delivery>/.written`;
- **the context's events module additively**: a line may be added, none removed. It is the contract;
- **new migration files only**, timestamped so two slices never mint the same name: `YYYYMMDDHHMM_<name>`,
  or `V<YYYYMMDDHHMM>__<name>` under Flyway. The shipped numbered ones keep working — the order is lexical
  either way, and every stamp sorts after every number;
- **the composition root** — one line per use case, the one code file every slice touches, resolved in
  split order at merge and allowed here for that reason.

Refused, each with what to do instead: the canonical slot at the feature root (`specs/<feature>/plan.md`,
`research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, `tasks.md` — links into `slices/<id>/`, never committed;
a regular file there is a record about to be lost, on every branch), another slice's directory or model
block, another context's code, an edited or deleted migration, a numbered new migration, and anything else
in the repository — `Makefile`, `project.json`, package manifests and locks, `scripts/`, `skills/`,
`commands/`, `agents/`, CI, the docs other than the model and its canvas — which is the host's: landed on `main`
before the fan-out, or handed back as the question it is. A refusal is a hand-back, not something to work around.

The base the branch is compared with is where it left `main`, or last merged it in. Every `main` the checkout
knows is tried — `main`, `origin/main`, their `master` spellings — and the newest base wins: `origin/main` alone
goes stale the moment `main` moves locally and is not yet pushed (a migration run there, then merged into the
slice), and a stale base charges the slice with `main`'s own files.
