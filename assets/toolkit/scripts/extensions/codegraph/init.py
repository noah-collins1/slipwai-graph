"""`./init --extension codegraph`: install and index CodeGraph, and point the agent at it.

CodeGraph (https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) is a local, 100%-offline MCP code-knowledge graph.
Its own installer already wires the MCP server into whichever coding agents it finds and appends its own
instruction block to their context files — but that config is the user's, on the one machine `./init` ran on,
and never reaches a container, a CI runner or the fresh session a `/cruise` iteration is. So this script does the
three things that belong to the project rather than to CodeGraph itself: index this repository, add one
marker-fenced pointer to `AGENTS.md` so the primary agent reaches for the graph on a cross-file question instead
of falling back to grep-and-read, and name the server in the committed project MCP file of every harness installed
here, so the connection travels with the checkout. The same block tells a delegated agent to probe its own session rather than assume it
inherited the primary agent's connection. The pointer says how to tell that an environment cannot reach
the index at all, because a checkout travels into
places its tooling does not, and `make check-codegraph` is what notices an index nothing is maintaining (on a `slice/<id>` branch, outside CI, it
compares only what changed and leaves the integrity check to the trunk and CI; its record is
`.codegraph/gate-memory.json`, and deleting that file makes the next run whole).
See docs/extensions.md for what every extension's `init.py` owes.

It indexes this project and nothing else. CodeGraph's own `codegraph install` also rewrites the global config
of every agent on the machine — `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, Cursor's, Codex's, VS Code's — which is
not a project's to change; the project-scoped MCP files below are what the checkout needs, and travel with it.

Nothing to install by hand: the pinned CLI runs through `npx`, so where Node is missing it is installed
(`scripts/install-tools.py`), and only where Node cannot be had is CodeGraph's own user-level installer run.
Never fails `./init`: a route that still cannot be found is reported, not fatal.

## CodeGraph
This project is indexed by CodeGraph (`.codegraph/`). **The index answers symbol questions; text search answers
questions about words.** Who calls a function, what it calls, where a type is used, what a change would reach:
ask the index first —

    scripts/codegraph callers <symbol>        scripts/codegraph impact <symbol>
    scripts/codegraph explore <names or a question>

`scripts/codegraph` runs the pinned CLI through `npx`, or an installed `codegraph`, so it answers in every session
with a shell — a delegate's included — whatever MCP tools that session was given; `codegraph_explore` over MCP is
the same index where your tools list it. A search of `spec.md`, `decisions.md`, the PRD, `model.yaml` or a test's
string literal ("done for the day") is a text search, and grep is right for it; locating a file by name is a
`find`, not a question for the index. Say which route you used when you report what you found.

**What holds this, so nobody has to remember it.** In Claude Code a hook refuses a search of the source for a
symbol — a name the index defines, or one shaped like one — from any session or delegate that has not asked the
index yet, and names the commands above; once it has, grep is its own business. Another hook syncs the index each
time a delegate returns. A `/cruise` runner opens the database before every iteration, integrity-checks it, moves a
corrupt one aside and rebuilds it (it is derived from the source and ignored by Git), and syncs a stale one; its
log says what it did, and `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py status` says how often each delegate asked the index
and which searched the source for a symbol first. A Claude Code session takes the same step when it opens, so a
`/drive` starts on a sound index too, and says so only when it had to act; `python3
scripts/agents/code_index.py health` is the same repair by hand.

**The connection travels with the checkout.** The project-scoped MCP file of every harness installed here
names the server, started through `npx` at the same pinned version: `.mcp.json` for Claude Code (with
`alwaysLoad`, so its tool is loaded at session start rather than behind the tool-search step), `.codex/config.toml`
for Codex, `.gemini/settings.json` for Gemini CLI, `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor, `opencode.json` for opencode.
Where a harness still lists `codegraph_explore` as a bare name with no schema, it is not loaded yet rather than
unavailable — load it by name through that harness's tool-search step, or use `scripts/codegraph`.

**It is only current while a client is attached.** CodeGraph's watcher runs in a daemon that starts with an MCP
client or a `codegraph` command, shuts down on an idle timeout, and turns itself off where CodeGraph decides it
is sandboxed — so the syncs above do the keeping, and `make check-codegraph`, part of `make verify`, rebuilds a
corrupt database, syncs a stale one, and fails with the date it was last written where the index still cannot be
made sound and current. A corrupt database is the one CodeGraph's own `status` and `sync` call up to date.
That is the whole run, which the trunk, every other branch and CI make. On a `slice/<id>` branch in a developer's
checkout, outside CI, the gate compares only what changed since its last whole comparison and leaves the integrity
check to the trunk and CI; it keeps that record in `.codegraph/gate-memory.json` (ignored by Git), and deleting that
file makes the next run whole.

**A sub-agent does not inherit this session's connection**, and needs none: `scripts/codegraph` is in its shell.
Do not pass the parent conversation merely to carry that fact — every harness receives this `AGENTS.md` block,
while a delegate keeps its focused stage brief. `commands/drive.md`, *Who runs each stage*, carries the same
boundary.

**Where no route exists** — no Node and no `codegraph` — `scripts/codegraph` says so; then say in as many words
that the answer is a text search ("the database is here, the tooling is not"), and work as a project with no
index would. `./init --extension codegraph` installs Node where the machine allows it and indexes again.
