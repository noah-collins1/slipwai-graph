"""Run the adopted UX gates over every browser app, and fail when one of them does.

The gates are plugin87's ux-ui-agent-skills kit, installed under `tools/ux-gates/` by `./init --extension
ux-gates`. Two kinds run here. The file gate always: `lint_hardcodes.py` over each browser app's `src/`,
which fails on a literal colour, pixel size or duration that is not a token — the rule `docs/design.md`
states, measured. The render gates when they can: over every `*.html` under each browser app's `screens/`,
in a real headless browser, contrast in light and dark across default, hover and focus, visible focus,
target size, overflow at phone widths, and axe. Which browser is asked once, before any of them runs: the
kit launches Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`), and in 2.8.0 two of its scripts — `verify_responsive.mjs` and
`verify_target_size.mjs` — crash where Chrome is not installed instead of falling back to Playwright's own
Chromium the way the other three do. So where Chrome is absent and that Chromium opens, every render gate
runs with a Node preload that retries a launch without the channel; where no browser opens, or Playwright
is not resolvable, the render gates are reported as skipped, never as passed, and a gate that still could
not open a browser is reported the same way rather than as a failure.

Three states are not failures, and each is said out loud. Not adopted: the extension is optional, and a
project that never asked for it has nothing to run. Adopted but not installed here: `tools/ux-gates/` is
ignored by Git, so a fresh clone or a CI runner has the election and not the kit — reported as skipped,
or as a failure when `UX_GATES_REQUIRE=1`, which is what to set wherever the kit is expected. No browser
app: nothing to measure.

What it costs is per screen, and that is the part a project feels. Each per-file gate launches its own
browser, four of them per preview, so the time is linear in `screens/` and every UX slice adds to it — a
project with 225 previews spent 24 minutes here, two at a time on a two-processor runner. Three switches
spread that, and none changes what passing means:

- `UX_GATES_JOBS=<n>` runs that many gates at once; the default is one per processor.
- `UX_GATES_SHARD=<k>/<n>` runs every n-th gate from the k-th, so n CI jobs cover every gate exactly once
  between them. `verify.yml`'s `ux-gates` matrix, which the extension writes, is the one that sets it.
- `UX_GATES_SINCE=<ref>` renders only the previews whose own file, or a local stylesheet they link or
  `@import`, changed since the merge base with `<ref>` (the working tree counts), and the directory gates
  only for an app with such a preview. Every preview again when this script, the extension, the lockfile
  or `verify.yml` moved, or when Git cannot answer. A pull request sets it; `main` never does, because
  `main` deploys and a browser upgrade arrives without a diff. The file gate over `src/` always runs.

Standard library only, like every gate script here; the kit's scripts are run as subprocesses.
