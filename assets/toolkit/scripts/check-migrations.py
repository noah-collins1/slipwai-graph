"""Hold schema changes to expand/contract, whatever language wrote them.

A deploy rolls: for a minute or so the release before and the release after run against one database, and
a rollback is the release before, on its own, against whatever schema the release after left. So a
migration that removes or reshapes something the running release still uses — drops a table or column,
renames, changes a type, makes a column NOT NULL, adds a NOT NULL column with no default — breaks one of
them. The constitution's rule is expand, then contract, in separate deployments. This is the gate on it:

- A migration with a *contracting* statement must say which earlier, additive migration it completes, in a
  comment line: `-- contract: 202609151030_orders_add_status` (`//` or `#` in a JavaScript or Python migration).
- That migration must exist beside it, sort before it, and must not be new in the same change: where git
  history is available, "new" is anything not yet in the base branch (`main`), or uncommitted when on it.

Comments are stripped before anything is matched, and only the `up` half of a JavaScript migration is read.
Every migration file under every `apps/*/` and `packages/*/` is checked, except inside the five directories
nobody reads — `.venv`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git` and the `target` at the root of a Java deployable
`project.json` records, beside its `pom.xml`, none of which is descended (a directory that is a recorded
deployable's path, or on the way to one, always is): `migrations/<n>_*.{sql,js,ts}` where `<n>` is the shipped ones' zero-padded number or a new
one's `YYYYMMDDHHMM` stamp, Flyway's `db/migration/V<n>__*.sql`. Nothing else in this repository is a migration.
