"""Hold `/cruise`'s record to its shape: every decision the run took, and every demo it ran, readable and true.

A run with nobody at the wheel is trusted through what it wrote down. `specs/<feature>/decisions.md` is the one
place every product decision the machine took can be read and overturned, and `specs/<feature>/slices/<id>/
demo-log.md` is what a person reads to trust an acceptance the machine gave. Both are append-only entries in a
fixed shape — `commands/cruise.md` shows it, and `.specify/product-owner.md` repeats it — and this is the
gate on that shape: an entry with a field missing is a decision nobody can audit, a `Written to` path that is
not in the tree is a decision that was never applied, and evidence that does not exist is no evidence.

What is held, one finding per line (the adversary log's row per finished slice included, because `/adversary` says
an unwritten row is a pass that has to be run again, and until now nothing noticed one):

- a decision entry is `## D<n> — <question>` followed by the fixed fields in order: **Stage** (with Slice, When,
  Iteration), **Question**, **Options**, **Decision**, **Why**, **Decided by**, **Confidence** (with Would
  reverse if), **Written to**, **Status**;
- entries are numbered contiguously from `D1`, in order;
- **Decided by** is `host (stage recommendation)`, `host (standing decision D<m>)`, `drive-skipper (<model>)`,
  `drive-bosun` — with or without its `(<model>)` — or `human`; **Status** is `standing`, `overridden by D<m>` or `overridden by human <date>`;
- every **Written to** path exists in the repository, and a path still carrying `<placeholders>` is a finding;
- a demo entry is `## <instant> — <verdict> · iteration <n> · drive-hand (<model>)`, its verdict one of
  `accepted`, `behaviour`, `implementation`, followed by **Started with**, **Driven through**, **Examples**,
  **Evidence**, **Feedback**; every **Evidence** path exists, beside the log or from the root, or is `none`;
- every slice the ladder calls done — a row in `specs/<feature>/slices/README.md`, or `status: implemented` in
  `docs/event-model/model.yaml` — has a `## <slice-id> · …` row in `specs/<feature>/adversary-log.md`: the attack,
  or the recorded skip, that `/adversary` writes after every acceptance. The model is the whole project's, so a
  slice in it counts for the feature its `spec` or `gwt` path is under, or, naming none, the one holding
  `slices/<id>/`; an implemented slice no feature holds is noted, not charged to every feature.

`python3 scripts/check-decisions.py --adversary-baseline` is for a project that migrated across that last rule: it
writes, once, a `## <id> · predates the adversary gate · <date>` row for every done slice without one, which the gate accepts
and which says the slice was never attacked. A second baseline is refused.

A project with no record anywhere passes and says so: the gate runs in `make verify` from the first commit.
