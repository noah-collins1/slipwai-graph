"""`/cruise`'s settings, and the outer loop that re-invokes it with a fresh context until the specs are satisfied.

`.specify/cruise.json` holds how `/cruise` runs `commands/drive.md` with nobody at the wheel — who decides a
product question, how a slice is released, what a demo is driven with, when a run parks. This reads the file
and says what each setting is and controls, checks a hand edit, and changes them through `--set`, refusing
anything the command could not act on. `run` is the loop: one headless harness session per iteration, each a
fresh context, until the last line of an iteration says `done`, a person stops it, or nothing can move. It is
the one thing that continues a run, on every harness: a `/cruise` typed in a session starts it, detached,
with `start`, and the session that typed it runs no stage of the ladder.

    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py                       # every setting and what it controls
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py --check               # well-formed; `make check-agents` runs this
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py --set enabled=true    # change settings, checked, any time
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py run [--feature F] [--no-park] [--sandbox] [kick-off…]   # the loop; `make cruise`
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py start [--feature F] [--no-park] [--sandbox] [kick-off…] # the loop, detached
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py watch [--minutes M] [--quiet S]  # the watch seat: the feed since the last watch
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py stop [--now]  # end the run after the iteration in flight, or now
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py tell [--now] <message…>  # queue a message for the next iteration; --now ends the one in flight
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py told        # inside an iteration: what a person queued since it started, or nothing
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py status      # whether a runner is running, and what the log says it is doing
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py denials     # every command an iteration was refused, from the stream: what to allow
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py resume      # print the checkpoint into a compacted context; nothing when none
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py compacting  # stamp the checkpoint before the harness compacts
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py loop        # what is reading this session's last line: the runner, or nobody
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py stopping    # a harness's stop hook: refuse to end a runner's iteration early
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py responded   # a harness's after-response hook: keep the last message for `stopping`

`run` marks every session it starts with `CRUISE_RUNNER=1` and `CRUISE_ITERATION=<n>`, which is how `loop` and
`stopping` tell a runner's iteration from a `/cruise` a person typed — where nothing reads the last line, so the
command starts the runner instead of running the ladder itself.

Which harness an iteration runs through is the registry's `headless` column (`scripts/agents/registry.json`):
the first installed harness (`.specify/integration.json`) with a verified headless command whose binary is on
PATH. A harness on PATH that was never initialised here is not used: its commands, delegate types and hook
files are not projected, so an iteration through it would run the ladder with none of them — `/cruise` itself
unknown to it — and the run would spend its stuck budget on that before parking with the wrong reason. An
editor with no command line of its own is paired with a CLI harness by `./init --integration <cli>`, which
Spec Kit installs beside the editor. `CRUISE_HARNESS_COMMAND` (a shell template with `{prompt}`) overrides
all of that, and `CRUISE_POLL_SECONDS` how long a parked loop waits, so a run can be rehearsed against a fake
harness.

A person stops a run with `touch .specify/cruise.stop` (`stop`), or by interrupting a foreground `run`: the
iteration under way is killed, its increment commits are on the slice branch, and the next iteration re-derives
from disk. A person steers a run with `tell`: the message is queued in `.specify/cruise-inbox.jsonl`, and the
next iteration carries it as `told: <message>` in its argument — the route the kick-off takes — so nothing
interrupts the iteration in flight unless `--now` says to, which ends that iteration the way `stop --now` does
and starts the next at once with the message. An iteration can also ask for what was queued since it started
(`told`), between stages, without waiting for its end. Every message delivered is in the iteration's log entry.
