"""What each stage of `/drive`'s ladder cost a slice, and how well it did — recorded where the slice's other
artifacts are, so a project accumulates a history rather than a log that scrolls away.

One record per slice, `specs/<feature>/slices/<id>/benchmark.json`, and one per feature for the stages above the
slice loop, `specs/<feature>/benchmark.json`. `/drive` opens an entry before a stage and closes it after:

    python3 scripts/agents/benchmark.py start specs/shop/slices/S1 implement
    python3 scripts/agents/benchmark.py end   specs/shop/slices/S1 implement verify_failures=1
    python3 scripts/agents/benchmark.py close specs/shop/slices/S1        # the shape, once the slice is archived
    python3 scripts/agents/benchmark.py                                   # the aggregate; `make benchmark`
    python3 scripts/agents/benchmark.py overview [shop]                   # writes specs/<feature>/benchmark.md; `/benchmark`
    python3 scripts/agents/benchmark.py --json
    python3 scripts/agents/benchmark.py cut-off "<why>"                   # close what an iteration left open; the runner's
    python3 scripts/agents/benchmark.py check                             # warns: anything open, a done slice unrecorded

Everything that a transcript, `tasks.md`, git or the record itself can say is read from there, never asked:
wall time; the agent type each delegate ran as, where the transcript attributes one; tokens by model, from the
harness's own transcript between the two cursors — Claude Code's
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl` and the sub-agent transcripts beside it, Codex's rollout under
`~/.codex/sessions/` — where `scripts/agents/registry.json` records one for the running harness, and `null`
with the reason where it does not; which model ran, from the same lines; the tasks `tasks.md` gained during a
converge pass; how many times converge ran; a stage re-entered after implementation; files and lines from
`git diff`. What nothing on disk can supply is passed to `end` as `key=value`: `gaps=N`, `findings=N`,
`seams=N`, `mutation_score=…` copied from the tool's line, `verify_failures=N`, `outcome=accepted|behaviour|implementation`,
`delegate=<boundary>` and `cycle=<unit>` for how an implement entry was delegated and driven with `split=N` for
how many groups its delegate fanned out into, and `model=` or `agent=` only where no transcript could say. A number that was not read is not written.
