"""The code index kept healthy, kept current and asked first — by the harness and the runner, not by a brief.

A `/cruise` iteration met all four ways an adopted index fails to be used, with nobody making a mistake. The
database was corrupt when the iteration started, and CodeGraph's own commands did not say so: on a malformed
`codegraph.db`, `codegraph status` reports the index up to date and `codegraph sync` exits 0, and only a query
fails. The watcher that keeps it current was off, which CodeGraph decides for itself in a sandbox. Delegates
reached the index as a deferred tool they had to load by name first, and grepped instead. And nothing counted
which delegate asked it. Each of those is a place a sentence in a brief was the only control.

So this script holds the index at the points the harness and the runner already own:

    python3 scripts/agents/code_index.py health   # open it, integrity-check it, rebuild a corrupt one, sync a stale one
    python3 scripts/agents/code_index.py session  # Claude Code's SessionStart hook: `health`, said only when it acted
    python3 scripts/agents/code_index.py sync     # Claude Code's PostToolUse hook: a delegate came back; sync
    python3 scripts/agents/code_index.py guard    # Claude Code's PreToolUse hook: a symbol search before the index

`health` is what `scripts/agents/cruise.py` runs before every iteration, what `make check-codegraph` runs on a corrupt
database before it judges one, and what a person runs to repair an index by hand. That gate runs it on the whole run
only: on a `slice/<id>` branch in a developer's checkout, outside CI, it compares only what changed since its last
whole comparison and leaves the integrity check to the trunk and CI; it keeps that record in
`.codegraph/gate-memory.json` (ignored by Git), and deleting that file makes the next run whole.
`health` itself compares the same way — through the gate's own functions and memory — on every branch, the trunk
included, wherever no CI marker is set: it hashes only what changed since the last whole comparison, says how many
files that was of how many, and always runs the integrity check. With no usable memory, or in CI, it hashes every
tracked file. A `health` that ends current, or synced with the comparison after the sync clean, records what it
vouched for in that memory as a passing gate run does, outside CI and in no other case. `session` is the same step at the
start of a Claude Code session — a person's `/drive` has no runner in front of it — and prints only what it did or
could not do, since a hook's output lands in the session's context. The database is ignored by Git and derived from the source, so a corrupt one loses nothing by being moved
aside (to `.codegraph/corrupt/`, the latest only) and rebuilt. `sync` keeps the index current while an iteration is
still editing: after each delegate returns rather than on CodeGraph's watcher, because the watcher is what was off.
`guard` refuses a search of the source for a symbol — the Grep tool, or `grep`, `rg`, `ag`, `ack`, `git grep` or a
`sed -n '/pattern/p'` through the shell — from a session or a delegate that has not asked the index yet, and names
the route that answers instead. A symbol is a name the index holds a definition for, or a name shaped like one
(camelCase, PascalCase with a second hump, snake_case). Words and phrases are prose, and a search confined to
documents is text search, which is right for them: `spec.md`, `decisions.md`, the PRD, `model.yaml`, a test's string.
Once the agent has asked the index, its greps are its own business, and a search of another checkout — where the
hook's `cwd`, a Grep `path` or a `cd` puts it outside this repository — is never this index's to answer.

Every route here runs the version the MCP server runs (`CODEGRAPH`), so two versions never write one database.
Standard library only, like every script the toolkit ships. Nothing here fails a command it hooks: a hook that
cannot decide allows the call.
