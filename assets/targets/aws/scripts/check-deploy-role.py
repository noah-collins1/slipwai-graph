"""Fail when the service stack declares IAM the deploy role is not allowed to create or delete.

Two stacks meet at the deploy role, and nothing else connects them. `infra/bootstrap/` makes the role once,
applied by a person with admin credentials (`make bootstrap`): PowerUserAccess, which is everything but IAM,
and IAM back on roles carrying this project's name. `infra/service/` is applied by that role on every push to
`main`, and is free to declare any `aws_iam_*` resource. So a slice that adds an IAM user, a managed policy or
an instance profile passes every gate, merges, and the first place the two stacks meet is the production
apply — which is refused part-way, after it has changed whatever it reached first, on an action the
pipeline cannot grant itself. The person who reads that failure goes looking for the permission in the
console, when the answer is a statement in `infra/bootstrap/main.tf` and a `make bootstrap`.

This reads both stacks and holds each `aws_iam_*` resource under `infra/service/` to the policies the
bootstrap stack attaches to `aws_iam_role.deploy`: the action that creates it and the one that deletes it,
each granted on a resource of the same kind (`role/`, `user/`, `policy/`, …) or on `*`. It reads files, runs
no `tofu` and no `aws`, and needs nothing running.

What it does not see, said so a pass is not over-read: the name a resource is given against the name the
grant is scoped to (both are usually interpolated, and the answer is in the plan, not the text); the read,
tag and update actions an apply also calls (PowerUserAccess covers none of them, so the bootstrap policy
lists them beside each create); and IAM declared inside a module. A resource type it has no row for is a
failure, never a pass, and the message says where the row goes.
