"""Hold every feature flag to what can be checked without an account, whatever language reads it.

A flag is what makes deploying and releasing two decisions. Every commit that passes `verify` on `main` is
applied to production, so unfinished work is safe there only while something holds it back — and the
constitution requires exactly that: incomplete work reaches production dark, behind a flag, with tests on
both paths. This is the gate on the half of that clause a static check can see. It reads files, runs no
`aws` and no `tofu`, and needs nothing running.

Four rules, each with the failure it exists to prevent:

1. **A declared flag is read somewhere.** A key in `infra/service/flags.auto.tfvars` that no source file
   asks for is dead configuration: a parameter in every environment, a line in `make flags`, and nothing
   behind it. Usually it is the remains of a released capability whose branch was deleted and whose key was
   not.
2. **A flag that is read is declared.** The more dangerous direction. A key nothing declares exists in no
   environment, so it can never be turned on — and from the outside that looks exactly like a feature that
   shipped and was fine. Nothing fails; the feature is simply never reachable.
3. **A new flag is seeded `off`.** The seed in `flags.auto.tfvars` is what a *new* environment starts at,
   and a flag being introduced is by definition not released yet. Seeded `on`, an environment created
   tomorrow behaves differently from the one beside it, and the seed cannot be corrected afterwards —
   `ignore_changes = [value]` means the stack never touches a parameter it has created.
4. **Both paths are exercised in tests.** While a flag is off, the branch running in production is the one
   the slice's own tests do not reach unless somebody wrote them; "it worked before the branch was added"
   is not evidence about the code after it. Heuristic, in the same way and to the same degree as
   `check-migrations.py` is heuristic: it reads the test corpus for the key driven on and driven not-on.
5. **A flag is read through the reader.** The service's own flag package is the only place that touches the
   environment — or, where the environment reads its flags from an AppConfig agent, the only place that
   calls it. A slice that reaches for the agent on loopback is refused outright rather than counted as a
   read, because the key never appears in its source: rules 1 and 2 cannot see a flag they are never told
   the name of. The package says so about itself: "os.Getenv is called here and in no other package." A hand-
   derived `os.Getenv("FLAG_CHECKOUT_V2")` at the point of use loses three things at once — the key-to-
   variable transform, so a typo reads as absent and absent reads as off and the flip merely looks broken;
   the one spelling of the key, so `flags.auto.tfvars` and the code can drift apart with nothing to notice;
   and the seam the reader exists for, since a function reading the process environment directly cannot be
   driven down both paths by a test, which is rule 4 quietly unsatisfiable.

**What counts as reading a flag.** A call through the service's own reader — `flagEnabled('checkout-v2')`,
`flag_enabled("checkout-v2")`, `flags.Enabled("checkout-v2")`, `Flags.enabled("checkout-v2")` — or the
environment variable itself, `FLAG_CHECKOUT_V2`. The variable counts deliberately: a hand-derived read is
a real read, and rules 1 and 2 would be lying if it were invisible to them — a key would look dead while
something was in fact consulting it. Rule 5 is what stops that allowance from becoming permission. The two
work as a pair: the variable is *seen* as a read, and *reported* as the wrong way to have made one.

Comments are stripped first, so a commented-out read is not a read, and neither is a test — a key declared,
tested on both paths and never consulted by the code is exactly the dead configuration rule 1 exists for.
The readers themselves and their own tests are skipped entirely: they demonstrate the transform with an
example key and are not about this project's flags, and the reader is of course allowed to name the
variable — being the one place that does is the whole of its job. A browser app is unaffected: it reads
`VITE_FLAG_CHECKOUT_V2`, inlined into the bundle at deploy time, which the variable pattern does not match.

**Which service a read belongs to** is the directory it is in, from `project.json`: a read under a
service is that service's, a read in a browser app is the service its `/api` goes to (a flag is declared
once, under the service that enforces it, and the bundle is built from that service's parameters), and a
read in shared code under `packages/` belongs to nobody in particular and satisfies whichever service
declares the key.
