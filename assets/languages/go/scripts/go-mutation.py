"""`make mutation` for a Go service: Gremlins, over a staged copy of the module and the workspace modules
it imports, held to what its own report says.

    python3 scripts/go-mutation.py <service> [--since <branch-or-commit> | --file <path within the service> ...]

Why a stage. Gremlins copies the module it mutates — the nearest `go.mod` upwards, never the workspace — to
a temporary directory and runs the tests there. Nothing above that copy exists: not the root `go.work`, not
the sibling module under `packages/` it names. A service that imports shared code by module path, as
docs/architecture.md says to, cannot build in that copy — and Gremlins scores the build failure as KILLED,
because `go test` exits 1 for a failed build and a failed test alike. Run naked on such a service it reports
every mutant in the importing package killed, 100% efficacy and a green target, with tests that cannot fail.

So this stages the service and each workspace module it imports into one temporary tree, writes into the
staged `go.mod` a `require` and an *absolute* `replace` for each — a relative one breaks in Gremlins' own
copy the same way — and runs Gremlins there with `GOWORK=off`. A service that imports nothing from the
workspace is staged the same way: one path, and it is the tested one.

What it holds the run to, beyond the threshold in the service's `.gremlins.yaml`, for the reason
`failWhenNoMutations` is true in the Spring service's pom — a silent pass on a target no gate runs is worse
than a red one:

- **Nothing mutated is a failure.** Gremlins prints "No results to report." and exits 0 on a module with
  no mutable code; here that is exit 1.
- **A timed-out mutant is a failure.** Gremlins leaves timed-out mutants out of the score, so a suite that
  slowed past `timeout-coefficient` passes on the mutants it managed. The fix is in `.gremlins.yaml`.
- **A scoped run whose mutants are all not covered passes.** Gremlins scores zero tested mutants as 0% efficacy
  and exits below its threshold; `--since` and `--file` read that from the report and say how many mutants no
  test reached, because *not covered is reported, never failed; a survivor fails*. The sweep is unchanged.

Only this module is mutated. A shared module under `packages/` is built here and never mutated: run this
against it as a service of its own if its rules deserve a gate of their own.

`--since <branch-or-commit>` scopes the run to the production files that differ from that ref, which is the
difference between a stage priced per repository and one priced per change: every mutant of every file the
change did not touch re-proves work that shipped weeks ago, at the price of a full suite run each, and a
stage that expensive gets routed around rather than read. Without it the whole module is mutated, which is
what a scheduled sweep wants. `--file`, repeatable, hands the files over instead and asks git nothing; it wins.

It is done here rather than with Gremlins' own `--diff`, which does not survive this layout. `--diff`
resolves changed paths against the repository root and matches them against paths within the module, so from
a module in a subdirectory — `apps/<service>`, every service this factory writes — every mutant comes back
SKIPPED and the run reports success having mutated nothing. Verified against 0.6.0 from both the module
directory and the repository root. The staged tree has no `.git` of its own either, and there `--diff` exits
1 without running. So the scope is computed here, from git, before anything is staged.

Gremlins has no include list: it selects by exclusion, so a scope is a complement, and this generates the
complement per run rather than writing one down — a written one is correct until the next file is added,
and says nothing when it stops being. The complement is passed as `--exclude-files`, which *replaces* the
`.gremlins.yaml` list rather than adding to it, so this reads that list and passes it back; a scoped run
that did not would quietly mutate the two trees the project excluded on purpose.
