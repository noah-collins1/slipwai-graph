"""The two guarantees about Postgres that the generated gate cannot make, from opposite directions.

The first needs a real database: two appends at one version, exactly one winner. It needs Docker, and it is
the reason the *generated* gate does not — this suite stands in for the `make test-integration` a project
runs outside `make verify`.

The second no local database can catch, which is why it is asserted against the emitted files instead. The
Compose Postgres runs `postgres:17-alpine` with no TLS at all, so it accepts an unencrypted connection and
`make migrate`, `make test-integration` and the suite above all pass against it — while RDS, whose parameter
group has carried `rds.force_ssl = 1` since Postgres 15, refuses the very same connection with SQLSTATE
`28000` on the first deploy. Nothing runnable locally can tell the two apart, so what the project is *told*
in production is checked here directly.
