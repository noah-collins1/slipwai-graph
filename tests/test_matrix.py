"""Every distinct native-gate shape of every backend, generated and held to its own gate.

The slowest suite in the factory by a wide margin: it generates each variant and runs the new
repository's native `make verify`, which means every supported toolchain has to be installed. CI runs it
as one job per backend, and `FACTORY_BACKENDS` is how a job names its slice — so everything in here reads
its backends from `backends_under_test()`, never from the catalog, or five jobs do the same work five times.
The shape of the scaffold itself, across every combination at once, is `tests/test_monorepos.py`; this
suite runs native tools only where a selection gives them a distinct tree to judge.
