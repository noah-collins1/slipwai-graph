"""No test the factory ships reaches for a mocking framework.

The house rule is in AGENTS.md, in `/drive`'s Implementation stage and in the `testing` and `finding-seams`
skills: a collaborator that has to be stood in for is a fake written in the test tree against the real
interface, never a framework that records a call sequence. A generated project's own tests are the first
thing an agent reads to learn what a test here looks like, so one framework mock in the skeleton teaches the
opposite of every page that forbids it.

Prose may name the frameworks — the skills that forbid them have to — so only files that are *code* and are
*tests* are read. Generated rather than scanned in `assets/`, because the asset a project receives depends
on its answers: this walks the combinations that bring the most test files with them.
