"""One `/drive` session runs every ready slice at once, once the contract is settled.

The method promised the parallelism — slices sharing only an event schema are independent — and `/drive`
exploited it only by being run twice. Three primitives make one session able to do it, read from the
reference implementations: a claim, a written shared-surface rule held by a gate, and one slice per delegate.
The tests here read the generated command for the rules and run the gate against a real repository, on a
slice branch and off one.
