"""Every backend's production image: built the way `make build` builds it, started the way an ECS task
starts it, and asked its readiness probe — `make build smoke-image`, the two targets `make ci` runs in a generated
project.

This is the proof "hello world to production" rests on, and the one a real deploy found missing: an image
can build and push perfectly and still die at start — a launch point the buildpack copied before it was
written, a PYTHONPATH that replaced the buildpack's own. Only starting the container catches that.

The migrate task's proof — that the buildpack launcher runs the `command` the image's own entrypoint
ignores — is `test_launcher.py`, built on the same `ImageProbe` base: it is about the builder, not about any
backend, and runs once where this runs per backend. In CI this suite rides in each backend's `matrix` job,
sliced by `FACTORY_BACKENDS` like the matrix itself, so five images build beside each other on one daemon:
everything a run puts on the daemon carries the backend or the process in its name for that reason.

A backend whose builder is `pack` publishes to a registry: Docker Desktop's containerd image store cannot
take a `pack` export directly (buildpacks/pack#2272), so the test starts a throwaway `registry:2` on the
daemon's own loopback — on the host network, listening on 127.0.0.1 itself rather than behind a published
port — and tells `pack`'s containers to share that network to reach it. The daemon then pulls the result
from the same address for the smoke. No port proxy sits on either path, which is what a published port
would have put there and what intermittently refused the connection (run 216). Those backends are
also built for Fargate's platform, `linux/amd64`, wherever this machine can run such a container — the
platform the pipeline builds, and the one that same image store has reliably exported the builder for; its
own platform otherwise. Every `pack` build in this file is for that one platform, the launcher probe
included: `--pull-policy if-not-present` hands pack whichever variant of the builder the daemon already
holds, and a build for the other platform then fails reading layers the daemon never pulled — `failed to
fetch base layers: open …/blobs/sha256/…: no such file` (run 228, on a Mac runner that had just built for
amd64). `IMAGE_REGISTRY` in the environment names a registry to use instead; `PACK_FLAGS` in the
environment is passed on, for a machine that needs more (a proxy's certificate, a mirrored run image).

Every `pack` build here names its build cache (`pack_cache`). Left to pack, the cache volume is named after
the image, and the image here is named after a registry on a port chosen at random — so on CI no build ever
found the cache the one before it left, and every run downloaded CPython, the Node engine and every Maven
dependency again: the python job spent eight of its ten minutes in this one build (run 140). The name is
per backend, so five builds on one daemon never share a volume, and per ref, because the workflow's
concurrency group already keeps one ref to one run at a time; the buildpacks still decide for themselves
what a restored layer is good for, so a changed requirement is rebuilt. And every build runs with
`--timestamps`, its phase lines printed on success as well as failure, so the log says where a slow one
spent its time instead of showing one `ok` eight minutes after the test's name.
