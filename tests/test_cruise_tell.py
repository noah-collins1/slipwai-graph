"""`/cruise-tell`: a person's word to a run under way. Queued in `.specify/cruise-inbox.jsonl`, carried by the
iteration the runner starts next as `told: …` in its argument — never pushed into the one in flight, unless
`--now` ends it for the message — and asked for between stages by the iteration itself (`told`). The runner is
run for real against the fake harness, which stands in for the person: it queues, interrupts and answers a park
from inside its own iterations, so nothing here depends on a timer racing the loop.
