"""`/cruise`'s stop hook: the end of a runner's iteration checked where a harness lets a hook refuse it.

`commands/cruise.md` said "do not wait to be invoked again" and was not enough twice in one session — once
ending after the upstream stages, once on a report that said "continuing now" — so the contract is enforced by
`scripts/agents/cruise.py stopping`, run from the hook file each harness reads: `.claude/settings.json` on
Claude Code's `Stop`, `.cursor/hooks.json` on Cursor's `stop`, `.gemini/settings.json` on Gemini CLI's
`AfterAgent`. Only in a session the runner started, which it marks: a typed `/cruise` runs no iteration, it starts
the runner, so there the hook is silent. All of it is run here for real, against fake events, a transcript and a
checkpoint.
