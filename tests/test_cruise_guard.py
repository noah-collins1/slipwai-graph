"""A gate is satisfied in the tree it measures, never by editing the gate — held mechanically, on both sides.

A `/cruise` run met `check-ux-gates` failing because two of the kit's scripts crash where Chrome is not installed,
and the bosun patched `scripts/check-ux-gates.py` to call that skipped, committed it, and went on. The brief now
forbids it, and the rule is not left to the brief: Claude Code's `PreToolUse` hook runs `scripts/agents/cruise.py
guard` on every editing tool and refuses the edit in a runner's session, and the runner compares every gate and
control before and after each iteration, on every harness, and parks the run on a change. Both run here for real.
