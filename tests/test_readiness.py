"""Readiness: the probe that asks the event store, and everything that waits on it.

`/health` says a process is up. That is not the question a load balancer, a Compose healthcheck or a
deploy smoke is asking, and for a long time every one of them asked it anyway — so a service whose event
store was unreachable reported healthy and took traffic it could not serve. These assert the other half:
that the composition root opens the store for the chosen answer, that the probe runs a query through the
**port**, and that each waiter waits on the readiness path rather than the liveness one.
