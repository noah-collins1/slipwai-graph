"""The Python backend's toolchain: a manifest, a committed lock, and uv between them.

Generation alone, no toolchain — whether `uv sync --locked` is *happy* with what the factory ships is
`tests/test_matrix.py`, which runs the real thing. What is here is the shape: that the manifest says what
this project's answers need and nothing else, that a lock resolved from exactly that manifest is committed
beside it, that the gate installs from the lock rather than resolving, and that nothing anywhere still
names `requirements-dev.txt` or the `.python-tools` directory it was installed into.
