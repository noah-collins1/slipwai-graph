"""No generated line is wider than the limit the same project's own linter enforces.

The project's name is part of the measurement. `java_package_segment` and `python_package_name` turn it
into the package every file names itself with, so the name is inside the width of every import line and
every javadoc link that spells a package out. A file that sits comfortably under the limit at
`delivery-starter` is over it at a name twice as long, and the person who finds out is whoever generated a
project whose `make lint` was red the moment it was written.

The limits are read out of the generated project rather than written down here — ruff's `line-length` from
the service's `pyproject.toml`, Checkstyle's `LineLength` and its `ignorePattern` from `config/checkstyle.xml`
— because a limit repeated here is a limit that can disagree with the one that actually runs. A backend
whose gate has no width rule contributes nothing and needs no entry; `test_the_check_measures_something`
is what stops that from quietly becoming all of them.

This is the cheap half of the pair. `tests/test_matrix.py` runs the real linters, but only on the
combinations it can afford; this generates the trees and measures them, which costs seconds and can
therefore cover the production target, both stores and both profiles.
