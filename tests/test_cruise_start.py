"""`/cruise` continues on every harness: which harness the runner drives an iteration through, and a typed
`/cruise` starting that runner detached rather than running the ladder in a session nothing re-invokes.

The registry's `headless` column is what the loop runs a harness through, read from each harness's own
documentation and dated; the runner takes the first installed harness with a row on the PATH, else any harness
on the PATH, and asks every harness but Claude Code to read the command file. `start`, `stop` and `status` are run
here for real, against a fake harness, and the runner is watched to its end.
