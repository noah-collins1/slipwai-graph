"""How a generated project's npm workspace gets installed: once, by one target, for the whole gate.

`[ -f node_modules/.package-lock.json ] || npm ci` used to sit before every npm line of every npm recipe —
sixteen copies of one decision in a default project, and one more with every recipe added. One file target
says it once, and every target that runs this project's own npm code takes it as a prerequisite, directly or
through `build-packages`. What this suite holds is the property, not the spelling: a fresh clone installs
once, a tree that is already installed installs not at all, and no entry point is left without it.

Asserted by asking Make what it *would* do (`make -n`) rather than by matching recipe text, because what has
to hold is the whole prerequisite chain and not one line of it — the same reason `test_shared_packages.py`
checks its own prerequisite that way.
