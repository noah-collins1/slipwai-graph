"""`/cruise`: `/drive` with nobody at the wheel — the agent as driver and product owner until the specs are satisfied.

What this gates is the spine the rest of cruise hangs from: the settings file a project has to opt into, the command
that runs `commands/drive.md` as written and says at every one of its stops what happens instead of a person, the
two delegates that answer those stops, the rows the models table and the benchmark gain for them, and the pages
that name them. Every phrase asserted here is one a person or a delegate acts on; the constants come from the
source module, so the text and the test cannot drift apart.
