"""What the last sweep of `/cruise` against `/drive` found lost between them, held here so it stays found: a
setting changed mid-run took effect only at the next run, and a process the demo left up — for an actor who,
under `/cruise`, is not coming — survived into the next iteration. Both are the runner's, run here for real
against a fake harness the way `test_cruise_runner` does; the command text and the registry rows those
findings changed are held beside the text they changed, in `test_cruise` and `test_cruise_start`.
