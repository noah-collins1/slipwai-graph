"""Nothing the prune leaves behind points at something the prune took away.

The pruner removes files; it cannot remove the sentence in a file it kept that tells the reader to go and
look at one of them. The result reads as a defect in the reader rather than in the text — an agent that
opens `apps/service/src/…` is told to compare this adapter with a sibling that is not in the repository,
or to read a file under a name it does not have here.

Two properties, both read off generated trees rather than off `assets/`, because what is stale depends on
the answers:

  1. a path or file name quoted in a retained file under `apps/` resolves in the tree, and
  2. a retained file does not point at an adapter by name — *the* SQLite adapter, *the* Postgres one —
     when the project has no such adapter.

Comparative prose survives both: "SQLite serialises its writers" explains why a guarantee needs a real
server and is true wherever it is read. What neither allows is the definite article pointing somewhere.
