# A tree that already passed is not judged again: the verify stamp every generated project carries answers first, from
# where it ships, so the factory's own gate is the one it generates. The four checks are `verify-checks`; CI never reads
# a stamp, because the script stands down under a CI marker and on the trunk. A slice of the suite (`TESTS`, `SKIP`)
# is not the gate, so it never asks the script: nothing reads, writes or removes a stamp for a run that skipped checks.
# The key also holds what each tool the suite looks for answers to `--version`, since a test skips when its tool is
# missing and a tool appearing or changing can change what the suite does. Only a tool this machine has is asked: the
# script cannot ask a missing one, and would then record nothing. `make` itself is always there, under the name it was run as.
