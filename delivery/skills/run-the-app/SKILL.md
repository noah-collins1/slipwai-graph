# Running slipwai-graph

The applications in this repository existed before the delivery method was installed around them, so nothing
here was generated and the factory does not know how any of them starts:

- `.` (python)

`project.json` records, for each, how its own build answers the Make targets (`commands`), and the Makefile
under `layout.delivery` runs those. How to *run* one — the command, the port, what has to be seeded first, the
runtime it needs — is written in **`delivery/survey/running.md`**, and that file is the whole of this skill: read it first. Where
it still says *not yet proven*, find the run path the way the existing README, container file or CI config
says, prove it once, and write it there — never here. This file is listed in `.written`: the factory's own,
replaced by `slipwai migrate`, and anything written into it is lost with the next version. The demo a slice
ends with is what the ledger exists for, and a run path that has to be rediscovered at the demo is the same
cost as having none.
