# The Nine-Step Workflow Design Process

Follow ALL nine steps for each workflow. Do not skip steps. Do not combine
steps. The process reveals understanding that shortcuts would miss.

## Step 1: Identify the User Goal

Ask until the goal is crystal clear:
- "What exactly is the user trying to accomplish?"
- "What does success look like to them?"
- "What would make this fail?"

Do not proceed until the goal is unambiguous.

## Step 2: Brainstorm Events

Sticky-note style -- capture all possible events without ordering:
- "What facts need to be recorded?"
- "What happened that we care about?"
- "What would an auditor want to know?"

Events must be past tense, business language, facts. Example:
`OrderPlaced`, `PaymentReceived`, `InventoryReserved`.

Keep asking: "What else? What am I missing?"

### Domain Facts vs. Runtime Context

Events must record **domain facts** — statements that are true regardless of
which machine, process, or environment replays them. Runtime context does not
belong in event data.

```
# Bad — runtime context leaks into the event:
ProjectInitialized {
  project_id: "abc-123",
  working_directory: "/home/dev/projects/myapp",   # machine-specific
  pid: 48291,                                       # process-specific
  hostname: "dev-laptop.local"                      # environment-specific
}

# Good — domain facts only:
ProjectInitialized {
  project_id: "abc-123",
  project_name: "myapp",
  initialized_by: "user-456",
  template: "web-app"
}
```

**Test:** "Would this field have the same value if the event were replayed on
a different machine?" If no, it is runtime context and does not belong in the
event.

## Step 3: Order Events Chronologically

Arrange brainstormed events into the timeline -- the "plot" of the workflow.

- "What happens first?"
- "And then what happens?" (repeat until complete)
- Identify the happy path and alternative/error paths

## Step 4: Create Wireframes

These wireframes do not need to represent the actual UI/UX of the
application. Their purpose is to provide a complete accounting of what data
a user can see and what actions a user can take from each screen.

For each user interaction point, create an ASCII wireframe showing:
- What data the user SEES (from read models)
- What data the user PROVIDES (command inputs)
- What actions the user can TAKE (buttons/triggers)

```
+-------------------------------+
|  Place Order                  |
+-------------------------------+
|  Items: [list from cart]      |
|  Shipping: [address]          |
|  Total: $XX.XX                |
|                               |
|  [Confirm Order]              |
+-------------------------------+
```

Every wireframe field must trace to an event field (displays) or a command
input (inputs). If you cannot trace a field, something is missing.

### Concurrency Check

If the domain supports concurrent instances (e.g., multiple orders, multiple
journeys), wireframes should show lists or tables, not single-item views.
Ask: "Can there be more than one of these in progress at the same time?"

## Step 5: Identify Commands

For each event, determine the trigger:
- "What triggered this event?"
- "Who or what issued that command?"
- "What information did they provide?"
- "Under what circumstances would this NOT happen?"

Commands are imperative, present tense: `PlaceOrder`, `ProcessPayment`.
Commands can fail; events cannot.

## Step 6: Design Read Models

Read models exist to support data displayed on wireframes as well as data
needed by automations. For each actor at each workflow point, and for each
automation:
- "What does this person need to see?"
- "What information do they need to make decisions?"
- "What data does this automation need to determine its next action?"

Verify every read model field traces back to an event. Example:
```
OrderSummary:
  orderId       <- OrderPlaced.orderId
  items         <- ItemAdded, ItemRemoved events
  totalAmount   <- OrderPlaced.totalAmount
  status        <- OrderPlaced, PaymentReceived, OrderShipped events
```

If a field has no source event, the model is incomplete.

### Concurrency Check

For each read model field, ask: "Can there be more than one of these active
at the same time?" If the domain supports concurrent instances, use collection
types, not singular values:
```
# Singular (only valid if business rule enforces one-at-a-time):
current_phase: string

# Collection (when concurrent instances exist):
active_journeys: [{journey_id, phase, started_at}, ...]
```

### Command Independence

Commands derive their inputs from user-provided data and the event stream.
Read models serve views and automations — they do NOT feed commands. If a
command needs to know whether something already happened, it checks the
event stream directly, not a read model.

- "Does the command rely on a read model to decide what to do?" → Wrong.
  The command should check the event stream for prior events.
- "Is an idempotency guard querying a read model?" → Wrong. Check the
  event stream for a duplicate event.

### No Read Models for Infrastructure Preconditions

Read models represent meaningful domain projections — not infrastructure
checks. If a precondition is purely about infrastructure state (does a
directory exist? is a service running?), it does not need its own read model.

```
# Bad — infrastructure check modeled as a read model:
ReadModel: RepositoryExistence
  exists: boolean    ← RepositoryInitialized

# Good — command checks the precondition directly:
Command: InitializeProject
  Precondition: directory exists (infrastructure, not domain state)
  Produces: ProjectInitialized
```

Infrastructure preconditions are either:
1. Implicit in the command's execution context (the OS provides them)
2. Checked as part of the command handler's implementation

They do not need a domain read model.

## Step 7: Find Automations

Look for automatic responses to events that involve decision-making:
- "Does anything happen automatically after this event?"
- "What business rules trigger other processes?"
- "Does the system need to check anything before acting?"

Pattern: Event -> Read Model (todo list) -> Process -> Command -> Event

**All four components are required for a true Automation:**
1. A triggering event
2. A read model (the "todo list") the process consults
3. Conditional logic that decides whether and how to act
4. A resulting command that produces new events

If there is no read model and no conditional logic — if the events are
always unconditionally co-produced — it is NOT an Automation. Model it as
a single Command slice with multiple output events.

**Test**: Ask "Can this automatic response ever be skipped or vary based on
system state?" If no, it is co-production, not automation.

Every automation must have a clear termination condition. Watch for infinite
loops.

## Step 8: Map External Integrations

Identify external system interactions using the Translation pattern:
- "Does this workflow receive data from outside?"
- "Does this workflow send data to external systems?"

Note only names and general purposes. No technical details (APIs, webhooks,
protocols). Example: "Stripe provides payment confirmation" -- not
"Stripe webhook sends POST to /api/webhooks/stripe".

### Data Flow Rules for Diagrams

When creating workflow diagrams, data flows follow these rules:
- **Actor/UI → Command**: User inputs flow into commands
- **Command → Event**: Commands produce events
- **Event → Read Model**: Events feed read model projections
- **Read Model → Actor/UI**: Read models serve views
- **Event → Automation Read Model → Process → Command**: Automations
  consult read models, but the resulting command still checks the event
  stream for its own validation

There must be NO `ReadModel → Command` edges in any diagram. If you find
one, the command is incorrectly depending on a read model.

### Infrastructure vs. Domain Translations

Ask: "Is this integration specific to THIS workflow, or would every
workflow need it?"

If every workflow needs it, it is cross-cutting infrastructure (persistence,
messaging, logging) — NOT a Translation slice. Note it as an infrastructure
dependency, not as a slice.

## Step 9: Decompose into Vertical Slices

List all vertical slices grouped by pattern type:

- **Command Slices:** Each command that produces events
- **View Slices:** Each read model/projection
- **Automation Slices:** Each automatic process
- **Translation Slices:** Each external integration

A good slice is: a complete user interaction, independently valuable,
testable in isolation, small enough for 1-2 days of work.

Bad slices: "Set up database" (technical, no user value), "Implement order
system" (too broad), "Create Order table" (implementation detail).

Also not slices: cross-cutting infrastructure (e.g., "Persist Events to
Database") that would appear identically in every workflow. Infrastructure
is not business behavior — document it in the domain overview, not as
workflow slices.

### Slice Independence

Slices that share an event schema are **independent** — connected by the
event contract, not by execution order. The event schema is the shared
contract between a command slice that produces events and a view slice that
consumes them.

```
# Bad — artificial dependency chain:
Slice 1: "Initialize Project" (must complete before Slice 2)
Slice 2: "Show Project Dashboard" (depends on Slice 1 running first)

# Good — independent slices sharing an event schema:
Slice 1: "Initialize Project" → produces ProjectInitialized event
Slice 2: "Project Dashboard" → projects from ProjectInitialized event
  (testable with synthetic ProjectInitialized fixtures, no Slice 1 needed)
```

- **Command slices** test by asserting on produced events (given prior
  events, when command executes, then these events are produced)
- **View slices** test with synthetic event fixtures (given these events,
  the projection shows this state)
- Neither slice needs the other to be implemented or running

### Apply Conway's Law: Which Lanes Are Which Context

Event Modeling ends by grouping the lanes into units that can change on their own — historically the
teams that would own them, but the boundary is in the model whether or not there are teams behind it, and
when one person or an agent does all the work it matters just as much: it is what stops one change from
rippling through everything. Here that step decides the bounded contexts, and it runs over the model
rather than over an org chart. Look across the slices for:

- the same word meaning two things — "Occasion" as a gift-giving date and as a billable line
- qualifiers creeping in to tell them apart — "gifting user", "billing user"
- clusters of commands, events and read models that never name each other's terms, joined only by an
  event one publishes and the other reads

Each such cluster is a bounded context: one vocabulary, one glossary, one `src/<context>/`. Record them on
the owning service in `project.json` as `contexts: ["gifting", "budgeting"]`, then give every slice its
`context:` beside its `service`. From then on `make check-model` requires the field and `make check-imports`
refuses one context reaching into another except through its `public` module. One vocabulary across the
whole model is one context — say so and move on; a context is not a service, and finding two does not mean
adding a deployable (`delivery/docs/architecture.md`, *Bounded contexts*, has when it does). This is a decision to
take with the user: the model shows the seams, the people who own the words confirm them.

## Output Structure

This repository records the outcome in one cumulative model plus one example map per slice, not in a
per-workflow directory tree. `delivery/docs/event-model/README.md` is the schema reference and
`delivery/skills/global-event-model/SKILL.md` is the recording procedure:

```
delivery/docs/event-model/model.yaml               every slice: pattern, actor, stream, events, reads, status
specs/<feature>/slices/<id>/examples.md   one slice's rules, examples and Given/When/Then,
                                          linked from that slice's `gwt` field in model.yaml
```

The diagram is generated from `model.yaml` by `make model` and checked by `make check-model`; the draw.io
canvas beside it by `make model-drawio`, held current by `make check-drawio`. Neither is ever hand-written.

## Facilitation Questions Quick Reference

**Domain Discovery:** What does the business do? Who are the actors? What
are the major processes? What external systems exist? Which workflow is
most critical?

**Events:** What facts need recording? What happened here? Would the
business need to know this?

**Timeline:** What happens first? And then? Can these happen in parallel?

**Commands:** Who initiates this? Is it user-triggered or automatic? What
intent does this represent?

**Read Models:** What does this actor need to see? What queries do users
run? Can there be multiple instances active simultaneously?

**Automations:** Does anything happen automatically? What business rules
apply? Does this trigger other processes?

**Edge Cases:** What if this fails? What if the user cancels? What if the
external system is down?
