# Survey

Written by `slipwai adopt` (1.5.2.dev0) from the tree as it was; `/survey` refreshes it. Every line names the
file that said so. Experimental: see `../docs/adoption.md`.

## Builds

- `.` — python, python, from `pyproject.toml`, python 3.11; what it is for, nothing here says

Wrapped as: `slipwai-graph` (`.`).

## Continuous integration

- `.github/workflows`

Proposed forge: `github`, from `.github/workflows`.

## How a change reaches production

- pipeline — `.github/workflows/package.yml`
- pipeline — `.github/workflows/publish-package.yml`
- pipeline — `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- pipeline — `.github/workflows/verify.yml`
- scripted — `assets/targets/aws/scripts/deploy.py`
- scripted — `assets/targets/azure/scripts/deploy.py`
- scripted — `tests/fixtures/adopt/converging/deploy.sh`
- scripted — `tests/fixtures/adopt/javascript-gitlab/deploy.sh`
- scripted — `Makefile`

Proposed: `pipeline`.

## Big issues that are quick wins

Each is a proposal, not a change the factory made; `/drive` offers them before the map's rows while any remain, a secret first, and `/survey` drops each as the tree stops showing it.

|---|---|---|---|
| `secret-in-tree` | `assets/backing-services/java/database_url.java:10` | a connection string with a password is written in the file | rotate it now — a key in Git history is public — then read it from the environment or a secret store and purge the history (`git filter-repo`) |
