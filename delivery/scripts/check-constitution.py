"""Check the ratified constitution still carries the principles this project cannot ship without.

`/speckit-constitution` fills a template, and a template is only a starting position: the phase that
writes `.specify/memory/constitution.md` can water a principle down, summarise five obligations into one
sentence, or drop a section that felt like boilerplate at the time. Nothing downstream notices. Every
later phase — plan, tasks, implement, review — reads that file as the authority it claims to be, so a
principle missing from it is not a documentation gap, it is a gate that silently stopped existing.

This gate states the floor. Three groups of requirements, and which apply is read from `project.json`
rather than guessed:

* **Minimum CD** — trunk-based integration, one automated path to production, build-once with deploy
  separated from release, feedback budgets, and the same bar for agent-generated change. Required in
  every profile, because these are what make the rest of the document enforced rather than asserted.
  These follow [MinimumCD](https://minimumcd.org/minimumcd/) — the industry-agreed floor for calling a
  practice continuous delivery, maintained by the MinimumCD working group. The requirements below
  restate it in this repository's terms and add the fifth, on agent-generated change, which the
  original predates; see `skills/REFERENCES.md` for what was taken and what was added.
* **The practices this repository's skills teach** — strict typing at the boundaries, ubiquitous language
  and domain types, the hexagonal boundary, acceptance-driven testing, observability, security and
  privacy, compatibility, ADRs, and a governance clause. Also required in every profile: a skill that
  contradicts the constitution loses, so a practice the team depends on has to be *in* the constitution.
* **The event-sourced obligations** — only where `project.json` claims the `event-sourcing` and
  `event-modelling` capabilities. A standard project is not asked for them, and
  `scripts/check-speckit.py` separately rejects a standard-profile constitution that mandates them
  anyway. The two gates are the same boundary read from both directions.

**What this can and cannot prove.** It reads for the vocabulary an obligation cannot be expressed
without, needing several independent signals before a requirement counts as covered. That catches the
failure that actually happens — a principle dropped, truncated, or replaced by a heading with nothing
under it — and it cannot judge whether what remains is *good*. Reviewers still do that. Wording is free:
paste `--requirements` output to start from the normative text, or write your own and keep the terms.

**When it applies.** `./init` installs the constitution *template* as `.specify/memory/constitution.md`,
placeholders and all, and the commit it pushes is meant to reach production: in a project with a
production target that push is the first deploy, and a gate that failed it would hold the walking
skeleton hostage to a document nobody has started writing. So while the file is still, byte for byte,
the template Spec Kit installed — recognised by the hash Spec Kit records beside it in
`.constitution-template.json`, or failing that by comparison with the templates the repository ships —
this gate reports that nothing has been drafted and passes. It applies in full from the first edit: a
placeholder left behind then is a constitution drafted and not ratified, which is the failure the
after-constitution hook and `make verify` exist to catch. And it applies regardless once any feature
exists under `specs/`, because a plan written against the template is a plan written against nothing.
