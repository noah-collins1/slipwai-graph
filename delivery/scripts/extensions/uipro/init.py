"""`./init --extension uipro`: install the ui-ux-pro-max skill into `skills/`, and point the agent at it.

UI/UX Pro Max (https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill) is a design-system generator that
runs offline: a Python search over local CSV data — styles, palettes, type pairings, chart types, UX rules
and stack notes keyed by product type — that answers "what should this product's screens look like" with
a coherent system rather than a guess. It ships as a skill with its own installer, and the installer's
job is to write fifteen per-harness copies; this script asks it for the one harness-neutral copy instead,
and puts that in the project's root `skills/`, which is the canonical catalogue `make agents` projects into
every harness and `check-agents` holds the projections to. The copy is ignored by Git (see `ignore` in
`catalog.json`): it is an installed tool, pinned by the CLI version below and reproducible from this one
command, not source this project maintains — the same footing as CodeGraph's index.

Only the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill is taken. The installer also writes `ui-styling` (Tailwind and shadcn, which
the generated browser app deliberately does not use), `design-system`, `design`, `brand`, `banner-design`
and `slides`, none of which is about a delivery project's screens.

A project with no browser app yet has nothing for it to design: the choice is recorded and waits, and it
installs itself once a browser app is there (`ready`, which `scripts/extensions/project.py` asks). Without
`npx` it installs Node itself (`scripts/install-tools.py`). Never fails `./init`: an install that still does not
take, or an unexpected layout, is reported, not fatal. See docs/extensions.md for what every extension's `init.py` owes.

## UI/UX Pro Max
`skills/{SKILL}/` is a design-system generator that runs offline: a search over local data that answers
which pattern, style, palette, type pairing, chart types and UX rules fit a product of this kind. Reach for
it **at `/drive`'s *Screen design* rung, for a screen `docs/design.md` has no decision for**, and for
one focused question — a component, a chart, a stack rule — with a single `--domain` or `--stack` search.
Read the skill's own `SKILL.md` for the query contract; the short form is:

    python3 skills/{SKILL}/scripts/search.py "<product type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system \\
        -p "<project name>" --persist --output-dir .

`--persist` writes `design-system/<slug>/MASTER.md`. **Commit it.** It is the evidence the decision was
made from, and the input the browser app's `tokens.css` is filled from — but it is not the decision.
`docs/design.md` stays the page every slice with a screen reads first: write what was chosen and why
there, in the same commit as the tokens, link the `MASTER.md` it came from, and where the two disagree the
page wins. Then take the plan through `skills/frontend-design`'s second pass — the review against the
brief for defaults that would appear whatever the product — before writing any code, and say on the screen's
`Designed:` line which search the decision came from.

**Check you can reach it before you trust it.** The search is standard-library Python 3 and travels with
the skill, so the only two ways it is unreachable are a checkout without the skill and a machine without
Python. `skills/{SKILL}/` is ignored by Git and installed by this extension, so a fresh clone, a
container or a CI runner has the pointer and not the tool: when `skills/{SKILL}/scripts/search.py` is
absent, or `command -v python3` fails, say so in as many words ("the extension is adopted here, the skill
is not installed, so this is a decision from `docs/design.md` and `skills/frontend-design` alone") and work
as a project without it would. Restore it with `./init --extension uipro`, which reinstalls the pinned
version. Say which route you used when you report a design decision.

**A sub-agent does not inherit this session's checks.** A fresh delegate looks for the script itself
before it claims to have searched, and says the skill is unavailable rather than inventing a palette.
