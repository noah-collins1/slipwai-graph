"""`./init --extension ux-gates`: install the ux-ui-agent-skills kit, and put its gates in `make verify`.

plugin87's ux-ui-agent-skills (https://github.com/plugin87/ux-ui-agent-skills, MIT) is a design kit whose
useful half, for a delivery project, is its gates: scripts that measure a screen and either pass or fail
— no literal colour, size or duration outside the design tokens; and, rendered in a real browser, WCAG
contrast in light and dark across default, hover and focus, visible focus, target size, no horizontal
overflow at phone widths, and axe's roles and names. `scripts/check-ux-gates.py` runs them and is part of
`make verify` from the moment this extension is adopted; the kit's WCAG checklists and its review workflow
are files under `tools/ux-gates/` that the `AGENTS.md` block below points at.

The kit is installed, not vendored: `tools/ux-gates/` is ignored by Git (see `ignore` in `catalog.json`),
pinned by the package version below and reproducible from this one command. A checkout without it — a
fresh clone, a CI runner — is what `check-ux-gates` reports as skipped rather than passed, and
`UX_GATES_REQUIRE=1` turns that into a failure wherever the kit is expected to be present.

A project with no browser app yet has nothing to gate: the choice is recorded and waits, and it installs
itself once a browser app is there (`ready`, which `scripts/extensions/project.py` asks). Without `npx` it
installs Node itself (`scripts/install-tools.py`), and `check-ux-gates` installs Playwright's browser the first
time it has Playwright and no browser. Never fails `./init`: an install that still does not take, or an
unexpected layout, is reported, not fatal. See docs/extensions.md for what every extension's `init.py` owes.

It also writes the one place the kit is expected: a `ux-gates` job in `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, between
markers so a second run rewrites it and nothing else. The render gates launch a browser per preview, so what
they cost is linear in `screens/`; the job spreads them over `SHARDS` runners from the first screen rather
than after a project has crossed its time budget, and on a pull request renders only the previews the change
can move (`UX_GATES_SINCE`, which `scripts/check-ux-gates.py` explains). Every shard installs the kit and a
browser and sets `UX_GATES_REQUIRE=1`, so a shard that could not measure is red, never a skipped green. It
sits inside `verify.yml` rather than beside it because a deploy is a `workflow_run` of `verify`.

## UX gates
`{KIT_DIR}/` holds the ux-ui-agent-skills kit, and `make check-ux-gates` — part of `make verify` — runs
the gates in it that are objective: a screen either passes or it does not.

- **Always:** `{KIT_DIR}/scripts/lint_hardcodes.py` over each browser app's `src/`. A literal colour,
  pixel size or duration outside `tokens.css` fails the build; it is the rule `docs/design.md` already
  states, now measured. A justified exception carries a `ds-allow-hardcode` comment on its line.
- **Where a browser is present** (`node`, `playwright` resolvable from the project root, and Chrome or
  Playwright's own Chromium — `npx playwright install chromium`): the render gates over every `*.html`
  under each browser app's `screens/` — contrast in light and dark across default, hover and focus states,
  visible focus, target size, no overflow at 280/320/414px, and axe. A screen preview under `screens/` is
  what puts a screen under those gates; the live routes are not rendered, because the gates read files and
  the app needs its API. With no browser the render gates are reported as skipped, never as passed, and the
  gate says which browser it ran on. A gate that fails or crashes is never made to pass by editing
  `scripts/check-ux-gates.py` or anything under `{KIT_DIR}/`: fix the screen, install the browser, or
  report the gate's own words.

**What this adds to `/drive`'s *Design review* rung.** Run `make check-ux-gates` first and fix what it
finds rather than carrying it as a note. Then the review itself, which the gates are not: render the screen
from its preview under `screens/` where it has one, and read the screenshots against
`{KIT_DIR}/workflows/design-review.md` (six weighted dimensions and Nielsen's heuristics) and
`{KIT_DIR}/accessibility/wcag-checklist.md` (POUR-organised, P0 first) as well as
`skills/web-interface-guidelines`, and name all three on the screen's `Reviewed:` line. Every gate green is
the objective half: screens have passed all of them and still shipped browser-default links and a raw
identifier. Never state a contrast ratio you did not measure; the gates print theirs.

**Check you can reach it before you trust it.** `{KIT_DIR}/` is ignored by Git and installed by this
extension, so a fresh clone, a container or a CI runner has the pointer and not the kit. When
`{KIT_DIR}/scripts/lint_hardcodes.py` is absent, `check-ux-gates` says so and passes, and you say so too
("the gates are adopted here and not installed, so this screen is unmeasured") rather than reporting a pass.
Restore it with `./init --extension ux-gates`, which reinstalls the pinned version. Say which gates
actually ran when you report a screen as checked.

**A sub-agent does not inherit this session's run.** A fresh delegate runs `make check-ux-gates` itself
before claiming a screen passed.
