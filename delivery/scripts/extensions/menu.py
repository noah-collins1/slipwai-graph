"""A checkbox menu for `./init`'s extension prompt: arrow keys (or j/k) move, Enter or Space checks the
highlighted row, a letter jumps to the first row starting with it, and a Confirm row at the bottom finishes
with whatever is checked — Enter *checks* rather than confirms because on a single-item list the intuitive
move is to press Enter on the thing you want, and silently adopting nothing would punish exactly that. The
list is framed by a one-line explanation of what an extension is and a key-hint footer, because this prompt
appears unannounced in the middle of `./init` — nothing before it says what is being asked.

Standalone and dependency-free on purpose — this ships inside a generated project, which has no access to
the factory's own `slipwai` package. It is the multi-select sibling of the single-select arrow-key
menu `cli_prompts.py` asks `slipwai generate`'s own fixed-list questions with (same termios/tty raw-mode and
ANSI-redraw technique); the two never share code because they run in different processes with different
questions, one selection each.

Reads the candidate list as JSON from stdin — `[{"key": ..., "name": ..., "description": ...}, ...]` — so
the interactive keys stay free to read the actual keystrokes from `/dev/tty` rather than stdin, which
`./init` may have already redirected by the time this runs. Writes the chosen keys, one per line, to
stdout; writes nothing when there is nothing to choose or no usable terminal, so `./init`'s
`selected_extensions=$(...)` capture is simply empty and everything downstream behaves exactly as if
`--extension` had never been mentioned.
