"""How `/drive` hands implementation to `drive-implement`: the boundary a delegate is handed, and the cycle it runs.

`.specify/drive.json` holds both — `delegate`: how much one delegate is handed, every rule of one user story, one
rule, or one task; `cycle`: how many RED tests one RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle opens with, a rule's examples together
or one at a time. This reads the file and says what the settings are and mean, checks a hand edit, and changes them
through `--set`, refusing anything the ladder could not act on. `commands/drive.md`, *How implementation is
delegated*, says which veto overrides a setting on a slice; nothing here decides that.

    python3 scripts/agents/drive.py                                   # both settings and what each means
    python3 scripts/agents/drive.py --check                           # well-formed; `make check-agents` runs this
    python3 scripts/agents/drive.py --set delegate=rule cycle=example # change them, checked, any time

A change takes effect at the next implementation stage `/drive` runs: the file is read before every one and
cached nowhere. `slipwai migrate` merges a newer factory's file over an edited one rather than replacing it.
