"""Which model runs each stage of `/drive`'s ladder, for the harness this project is initialised for.

`.specify/models.json` holds the choice — a role per stage, and per harness what each role maps to — and
`scripts/agents/registry.json` says whether the harness can act on it at all. This reads both and prints the
one line `/drive` needs before a stage: the model to delegate to, or why the stage runs on the host model.
Nothing is guessed: a role with no identifier mapped, a harness the registry records no mechanism for, and a
project with no table at all are each said in words, so a stage that did not switch is a stage that says so.

    python3 scripts/agents/models.py              # the whole table, per installed harness
    python3 scripts/agents/models.py implement    # one stage, keyed by the command it runs
    python3 scripts/agents/models.py --check      # the table is well-formed; `make check-agents` runs this
    python3 scripts/agents/models.py --set implement=strong claude.fast=haiku   # change it, checked, any time

A change — by hand or with `--set` — takes effect at the next stage `/drive` runs: the table is read before every
stage and cached nowhere. `slipwai migrate` merges a newer factory's table over an edited one rather than
replacing it, so a mapped identifier survives the way every edit to a generated file does.
