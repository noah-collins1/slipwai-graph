"""Hold the convergence map to the tree: fail a row that claims a rung the repository contradicts, and a page
that no longer matches the record.

    python3 scripts/check-convergence.py

`project.json`'s `convergence` rows say where an adopted repository stands on each ladder (brownfield adoption;
experimental). Most rungs only a person can establish, and those stand as written. What the tree can contradict
it does: a constitution that is still the template cannot be `ratified`; a test suite the ratchet quarantines
cannot be `tests-pass`; a repository whose release path is `manual` is not on `pipeline`; an application whose
role is not established is not `named`. An `unrecorded` row passes with a line saying so — it is a question, not
a gap. A page rendered from other rows than the record now holds is stale, and fails: `/survey` regenerates it.
