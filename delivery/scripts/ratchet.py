"""Run a recorded gate over code written before the gate existed, and fail only on what is new.

    python3 scripts/ratchet.py <application> <target> -- <command...>

A repository the delivery method was installed around (brownfield adoption; experimental) has a linter and a
type checker of its own, and on day one they are usually red: the rules arrived after the code did. Turning
them off would lose the rule; leaving them red would teach everyone that red means nothing. So this runs the
recorded command, reads its findings, and holds the code to a **baseline**: the findings that were there when
the baseline was recorded pass, and any finding not in it fails. The baseline only tightens — fixing a finding
never makes anything else fail, and `make ratchet-tighten` re-records the current findings once they shrink.

A finding is a line of the command's output that names a file in this repository *at a position* — `src/a.js:3:7`,
`Foo.cs(3,7)` — which is how every linter and type checker reports one; the position is then dropped, so that
editing above a known finding does not make it look new, and a line that merely mentions a file (`> node
lint.js`) is not a finding. A path is resolved against the directory the build runs in as well as the root —
`project.json` records it, and a wrapped application's commands usually start `cd <its directory> &&` — and
recorded root-relative either way, so a finding compares the same however the tool that printed it spelled it. A test runner names the test rather than a file — `--- FAIL: TestX`, `not ok 3 - adds`,
`FAILED tests/test_a.py::test_b`, Surefire's `[ERROR]   ShopTest.adds:42` — and each of those is a finding too,
`test: <name>`, so that a second failure beside a known one is new and named. Where a red command's output has
neither, this cannot tell new findings from old: the exit code is compared instead, and the report says so. A
command that could not run at all — its tool is not on this machine, which the shell reports as exit 127 (not
found) or 126 (not executable) — has no findings to record: the run fails, names the tool, and writes nothing,
because a baseline of "the build tool was missing" would pass forever on any machine that lacks it.

`test` runs through the same ratchet, with one difference: a suite that is red on the day the method arrives is
not quarantined behind anybody's back. The first run stops, shows the failures, and says what quarantining means;
`make ratchet-tighten`, once somebody has read them, records the state and from then on the run says the suite is
**quarantined** — passing on what was recorded, failing on a new failure the output names — until it is green and
`make ratchet-tighten` clears the entry. Two real adoptions found a red suite passing `verify` on a laptop with
nobody having decided that, and recorded it as the bug it was.

The baseline lives beside this script's Makefile as `baseline.json`, committed. Without an entry for an
application and target, `lint` and `typecheck` are recorded from the current findings and the run passes — locally
only: on CI (the `CI` variable set, as every forge does) a missing entry fails, because a baseline recorded on a
build machine is one nobody looked at and nobody committed. `RATCHET_TIGHTEN=1` re-records an entry unconditionally.
