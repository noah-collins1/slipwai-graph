# Add service

A service is a change to the list in `project.json` and a regeneration of everything that reads it — the
Makefile, Compose, CI, the workspace, `delivery/scripts/verify`, the prose that lists the services. The factory's
`add-service` makes both. Nothing here is copied from `.` by hand: a copy has to find the nine
files that name it, and misses the tenth.

## What is here



## Decide with the user, not for them

- **Name** — `apps/<name>` and its Compose service: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, and none of the
  names above.
- **Language and framework** — this project has no service the factory made to take a language from, so `--language` is required.
  Another language beside it is
  `--language typescript|python|go|java`; a language with more than one framework also takes
  `--framework quarkus|spring-boot`.
- **Answers** — one flag per question: `--event-store`, `--http`, `--auth`, `--users`.
  An axis without a flag takes the backend's own default. `add-service --help` lists the
  options this project's target allows.
- **Purpose and contexts** — `--purpose "<what it owns, in a sentence or two>"` and `--context <name>`, once
  per bounded context the service holds. The purpose is what `/drive` reads when it decides which service a
  slice belongs to: a service added without one is a directory the loop cannot place work in, and it will
  stop to ask before it does. A context is one already on the list above, or a new one; without any the
  service is a context of its own. A context may span several services; the tree stays `apps/<name>`.
  A service already listed is described after the fact: `<factory> describe-service <name> --purpose "..." --context <name>`.

The language, the store, and what the service owns are product decisions. When the request does not name
them, ask; taking `slipwai-graph`'s answers is the default for the first two, and saying so is part of
asking. Someone asking for a service has a reason for wanting it separate — the purpose is that reason,
written down. The port is the command's own decision — the next one free — and is not asked.

## Is a service the right shape?

A new bounded context is not by itself a reason for a new service. This project starts as one service that
may hold several contexts as `src/<context>/`, each behind its own `public` module, with `make check-imports`
keeping them apart — and that is where a context whose boundary is still being found belongs. A service is
the right shape when there is a *deployment* reason: its own release cadence, its own scaling or runtime, a
data store of its own, another team, another language. When the request is "a context for X" rather than
one of those, say so, and offer to add `X` to `slipwai-graph`'s `contexts` in `project.json` instead —
`delivery/docs/architecture.md`, *Bounded contexts*, has the three rungs and the reasoning to point at.

## Find the factory

The command belongs to the factory that generated this repository, not to the repository. It is
`slipwai add-service` where `slipwai` is on the `PATH` — installed with pip, or a released executable — and
`path/to/slipwai/slipwai add-service` from a checkout. If neither is at hand, ask where the
factory is. A wrong guess at its location is a stop, not a reason to start copying `.`: building
the application by hand is the thing this command exists to prevent.

## Run it

1. `git status --porcelain` prints nothing. The command refuses an unclean tree so that `git checkout . &&
   git clean -fd` undoes exactly what it wrote and nothing else; commit or stash first rather than working
   around the refusal.
2. `<factory> add-service <name> --purpose "<what it owns>" [--context <name>] [--language <language>] [--<axis> <answer>]`, from this directory.
3. Read its report: what it added under `apps/<name>`, and which files it regenerated from the list.

## Then

- `git diff` over the regenerated files. A hand edit that came back changed there was made to a file the
  list drives; move it somewhere the generator does not own, then rerun.
- `make verify` — green with the new application before anything else is done to it.
- Say how it runs: `make dev-<name>` in the foreground, `make demo` with the rest, and its port from the
  report. Its health example is the placeholder the first slice replaces; `/drive` from there.
- It shares the local backing services with every other service — one `DATABASE_URL`, one database. That is
  right for a walking skeleton and wrong for a product: give it its own database or schema before it owns
  any data, and say so when handing it over.

Nothing is committed by the command. Commit the result as one change, and say what was added and how to
run it.
