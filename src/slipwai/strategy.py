"""Which change strategy this repository's trigger and its map recommend — *leave it* included — and what,
if anything, has been decided.

Brownfield adoption (experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word). `docs/change-strategy.md` says a programme
whose trigger is an end-of-life runtime stops after the language and framework rungs and has succeeded, and that
one whose trigger is "cannot ship" finds its problem at the architecture rung and needs the five below it first.
This is that page's judgement made mechanical enough to write on the map: the trigger (`project.json`'s `why`)
is read for what it names — a platform, a delivery problem, a change problem, a capability or a host — and the
map says what has to hold before anything architectural is worth starting. A trigger that names none of them,
or no trigger at all, recommends leaving the architecture where it is; the delivery rungs pay off regardless.

A recommendation is not a decision. The decision is an accepted ADR under `docs/adr/` carrying a `Strategy:`
line, read from the tree like every other fact, and `/strangle` refuses to go beyond it. *Leave it* is a decision
like any other, and finishes the axis. Rewrite is never recommended; a person decides it, and says why.
