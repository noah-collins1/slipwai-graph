"""`adopt --refresh`: survey an adopted repository again, and reconcile what is found with what was recorded.

Brownfield adoption (experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word) records facts, not answers, and code
changes: a build gains a linter, a runtime pin moves, a schema tool arrives, a directory starts building. So
the survey is re-run and its findings meet `project.json` under one rule, which is the rule provenance
exists for. A fact recorded as `detected` is the tree's own word and is refreshed in place — and every file
that reads it is regenerated, the way `add-service` regenerates what the manifest drives. A fact a person
`confirmed` or `overrode` is theirs: a detection that disagrees with it is *reported*, side by side with the
record, and never applied. A directory that builds and has no record is reported, not added — whether it is
part of this system is a decision.

Nothing is committed: like `add-service`, this writes and leaves the result to be read and committed as one
change, so it refuses an unclean tree.
