"""Turning one set of answers into a repository on disk.

The whole of a generated project is assembled here as a path-to-content map and written in one pass, so
there is exactly one place that knows what a project is made of — and the order two contributors disagree
in is stated rather than emergent: `apps/web` owns the npm workspace when there is a frontend, so the
frontend's manifests are written over the backend's.

    `apps` is the list of applications the project has — each service with its own language, framework and
    selection, and each browser app with the service it proxies to. Every part that names an application
    takes the list; a part that has to speak in one language (the first slice's paths) speaks the first
    service's, and the skills' example snippets speak every language a service is written in, one labelled
    block per language. `add-service` and `add-frontend` call this with one more application
    on the list and write what changed, which is how a later one gets exactly the files the first did.

    The target reaches the parts that have something to say about it — `project.json`, which records it; the
    Makefile, `.gitignore`, the README, `AGENTS.md`, the docs and the agent settings, which gain a production
    section under a real one; `infra.py` and `deploy_workflow.py`, which contribute nothing under `none`; and
    each backend, which gives a service a flag reader only where there is somewhere to deploy (`flags.py`).
    Every other part is the same file whatever the destination.

    `layout` is where the factory's own material lives in the repository: everything is assembled for the
    root, as every generated project has it, and placed and re-pointed as the last step where `project.json`
    says the delivery material lives elsewhere (`layout.py`). `adoption` says the method was installed around a
    repository that already existed: `project.json` records it, `docs/adoption.md` explains it, and the set is
    cut to what such a repository takes from the factory (`project/adopted.py`). An application on `apps` that
    the factory did not make (`generated: false`) is recorded and otherwise nothing any part here names —
    `services_of` and `web_apps` mean the generated ones.
