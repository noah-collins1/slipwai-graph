"""`slipwai migrate`: bring a generated project up to this factory's version, in one command.

`replay` writes what this factory generates for the project's answers as a commit on the project's own
history; `migrate` is that plus the merge, because the two `git` commands between them are the same every
time and nobody should have to remember them. Run inside a generated project on a clean tree, it replays
into a temporary directory beside the project, fetches that one commit into the project — after which the
directory has nothing the project's `.git` does not — and merges it. A clean merge is one commit, and
`git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD` is its undo. A merge with conflicts is left in progress, exactly as `git` leaves
it, with each conflicting file named and the two ways out spelled: resolve and commit, or abort.

The tree has to be clean first, for the same reason `add-service` asks: so that everything uncommitted
afterwards is this command's, and the way back is one command. Nothing is pushed.

One thing the merge cannot do, and this command finishes afterwards: a project *derives* local files from
factory-owned sources. `./init` projects elected extension guidance into `AGENTS.md`, then commands, skills
and agent types into each installed harness. Neither the adopted marker region nor those harness-local
copies exists on the factory's side of the merge. Re-derive them here, extension first so copied contexts
receive its current block. The committed `.slipwai/extensions.json` records the election; a legacy project
with no record is inferred once from markers. Setup and the interactive menu never run during migration.
