"""Adding a service or a browser app to a generated project, with the generator's own code paths.

`add-service <name>` is run inside an existing generated project. It reads `project.json` for everything the
project was given — profile, frontend, target, and each service's language, framework and selection — puts
one more service on the list, and asks `scaffold.project_files` for the whole project twice: once with the
list as it was, once with the new service on it. Every file under the new service's directory is written,
and so is every other file whose content differs between the two — which is exactly the set the manifest
drives (the Makefile, Compose, CI, the workspace, `scripts/verify`, the prose that lists the services),
derived rather than kept as a list here. Then the same pruner generation runs cuts the new service down to
what this project actually has, so a project that dropped Keycloak with `./init` gets a second service with
no auth adapter either — unless the new service was asked for it by name.

The new service may be in another language: `--language python` beside a TypeScript first service. Without
a language it takes the first service's; without an axis flag it inherits the first service's answer where
its own backend offers it, and falls back to that backend's default where it does not (a Python service
cannot inherit Fastify, so it gets FastAPI).

`add-frontend <name> [--api <service>]` is the same operation for a browser app: the skeleton under
`apps/<name>` on the next dev-server port, proxying `/api` to the service it names (the first by default),
and the same regeneration of what the list drives — which is also how a project generated with
`--frontend none` gets its first browser app.

`describe-service <name> --purpose ... --context ...` records, after the fact, what a service the list already
has is for — the two fields the delivery loop places a slice against, which `generate` and `add-service` take
at scaffold time and which are otherwise found later, when the model's lanes or the specification's vocabulary
say what the contexts are. It scaffolds nothing: `project.json`'s entry is edited in place and every file
whose content the two fields reach — the architecture page, the agent guidance, the commands that list the
applications — is regenerated, the same way as above, so the file an agent reads says what was recorded.

Nothing is committed. The tree has to be clean first so that `git checkout .` and `git clean -fd` undo the
whole thing, and the command says what it wrote and what to run next.
