"""Whose uncommitted changes these are: the method's own, which a run may write over, or a person's, which it may not.

Brownfield adoption (#74; experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word). `/ground` records its answers one at a
time — `adopt --confirm` for each application, the rows in `project.json`, `adopt --refresh` so the pages follow —
and commits them as one change at the end. Each of those commands refused any uncommitted change at all, so the
first answer was refused by what `./init` had just left for the person to read, the second by the first, and the
refresh by the rows it exists to follow. The first repository taken end to end got through by committing after
every answer, which is the history nobody asked for, and by an agent deciding on its own to commit init's output.

What the refusal protects is a person's work, and a run can only lose that where it writes. So it looks at the
paths this run writes — the factory's listing in `.written` and the survey's pages — and refuses only where one of
those holds an uncommitted change that is not what slipwai itself last left there. What slipwai left is recorded,
path by digest, in `.delivery-tools/written.json` — ignored, so it belongs to this checkout and is never
committed, and outside `.git`, which an agent's sandbox can make read-only (Codex's does). Everything else
uncommitted — `project.json`, which is the input, what `./init` wrote, and a person's own source — is left alone,
because nothing here touches it.
