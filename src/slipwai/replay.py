"""`slipwai replay`: this factory's output for a project's recorded answers, as a commit that project can merge.

A generated project owns every one of its files, and the factory never reaches in to overwrite one. What it
can do is *offer*: emit, from the answers `project.json` records, what this version of the factory would
generate for them — into an empty directory beside the project, as a Git repository whose one commit sits on
the commit the project was scaffolded as. Everything a three-way merge needs is then in place. The project's
root commit is the base, the project's `main` is one side, the replay is the other, and `git merge` says
which files the factory alone changed (taken silently), which the project alone changed (kept silently), and
which both changed (a conflict, decided by the project). That is the upgrade path: a proposed merge, never a
mutation, and `docs/upgrading.md` is the recipe around it.

Two things make the replay a fair "theirs" rather than a fresh project that happens to share a name. The
manifest's provenance is carried through — `generatedWith` stays what it was, `updatedWith` becomes this
version — so the merge moves exactly the field that changed. And the features the project has since taken
away with `./init` stay away: what is on the project's disk decides, as it does for `add-service`, so a
project that dropped Keycloak is not offered it back.

The base is the newest commit in the project's history that the factory itself made: the scaffold the first
time, and after that the last replay the project merged — so a second upgrade measures from the first, not
from the beginning, and a field both moved (`updatedWith`, the README's version line) merges rather than
conflicts. A history that has lost that authorship falls back to its root commit, and `--base` names another
parent outright. A project that is not a Git repository gets the tree and no parentage — a diff by hand is
still a diff the project could not have had.
