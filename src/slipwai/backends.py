# One version each, everywhere: the CI images below, `setup-node` and `setup-python` in both generated
# workflows, `images.py`'s buildpacks, and the `.nvmrc` and `.python-version` a project is pinned with
# (`project/pins.py`). A second copy of a toolchain version is one that is already wrong somewhere.
NODE_MAJOR = 24
PYTHON_VERSION = "3.13"

# The uv a generated Python project is built against, pinned in the one place everything that installs it
# reads: the CI workflow's install step, the Compose container's setup line, and the message
# `scripts/verify` prints on a machine that has none. A laptop uses whatever uv it already has, exactly as
# it uses its own npm and its own Go — this pin is for the places where the factory does the installing.
UV_VERSION = "0.9.26"

# Where a command below says "this service's directory". Every recipe that names a service's path spells
# it with this token and is stamped per service by `tooling.for_app`, which is what lets one table serve a
# project with any number of services — `apps/service` is the first one's path, not the table's business.
APP = "__APP__"

# Where a command below says "this family's verify script". `scripts/verify` while a project has one
# language family; `scripts/verify-<family>` once it has several, with `scripts/verify` dispatching to each
# — see `tooling.verify_path`. Only Python's recipes run modes of their own script, so only they say it.
VERIFY = "__VERIFY__"


# Every Maven invocation this factory writes, spelled once. `-B` because a recipe is never at a terminal
# and Maven's progress animation is noise in a CI log; `-q` because a passing gate should say nothing.
#
# `./mvnw`, not `mvn`. Maven was the one unpinned tool in a backend where Quarkus, Temurin, Checkstyle,
# PMD, SpotBugs, Error Prone and NullAway are all pinned exactly, and a wrapper is how this ecosystem
# spells that pin. The default wrapper genuinely cannot ship from here — it needs a `maven-wrapper.jar`
# beside the script and `assets/` is text or it is nothing — but `-Dtype=only-script` emits three text
# files and no jar, which is what `assets/languages/java/build/` carries — the language family's tree,
# shared by both Java backends, because a build wrapper belongs to Maven rather than to whatever owns
# startup above it.
#
# The download this adds is a distribution per `maven-wrapper.properties`, not per build:
# `actions/setup-java@v5` caches `~/.m2/wrapper/dists` under its own key derived from that file alone
# (`additionalCaches`, so `cache-dependency-path`'s pom does not rotate it), and `COMPOSE_CACHES` already
# holds the whole of `/root/.m2` for the containers. The fetch itself needs very little of an image: curl
# or wget, or failing both a `Downloader.java` the script compiles with the JDK, and it takes the `.tar.gz`
# where `unzip` is missing — which is what happens in `ci_image` below, and is proven by `make demo`.
MAVEN = f"cd {APP} && ./mvnw -B -q"

# Resolve and compile everything the gate will need, main and test alike. There is no `mvn install-deps`: in Maven,
# downloading dependencies is a side effect of needing them, so the honest spelling of "install" is the first build.
MAVEN_READY = f"{MAVEN} -DskipTests test-compile"

# What has to be installed inside `ci_image` before `make` can run there.
#
# Almost always nothing: `node:`, `python:` and `golang:` all ship GNU Make, so their containers run the
# same `make dev` a laptop does with no preamble. No official Maven or JDK image ships it — checked across
# `maven:*-eclipse-temurin-25`, its `-noble` and `-alpine` variants, and `eclipse-temurin:25-jdk` — so a
# Java container has to install it, and both places that run `make` inside a container need to know.
#
# A Dockerfile would be the other answer, and it is the wrong one here: `make demo` runs the checkout rather than a
# built image precisely so a demo can never be a stale copy of the code, and so there is no second definition of the
# app's layout to keep in step. One `apt-get` at container start is the cheaper side of that trade.

# arranged with a volume.
#
# `MAVEN_ARGS` is applied to every `./mvnw` invocation in the container, and `service.build.dir` is the pom
# property the build directory is declared through — `project.build.directory` is read-only, so there is no
# way to move the output from the command line without that indirection. The path is outside `/workspace`,
# so nothing about the build touches the mounted checkout at all: no root-owned `target/`, and a host-side
# `make verify` still works immediately after `make demo`.

# Which of a backend's own skeleton files have to arrive runnable. The toolkit's executable bit can be read
# off disk — `assets/toolkit/` is committed with it set, and everything there lands at the path it is
# committed at — but a language's skeleton is written under each service's directory, so its asset mode
# cannot answer a question asked about the generated path. That pair has to be stated, which is what this
# is — relative to the service, and stamped per service by `toolkit.executable_paths`.
#
# `mvnw` and not `mvnw.cmd`: the wrapper plugin marks only the shell script executable, and a `.cmd` has no
# use for the bit. A lost `chmod +x` is a fresh clone where every Maven goal reports "permission denied",
# so `tests/test_matrix.py` asserts the mode on the written file rather than trusting this table.
# One frozen set, named once and referenced by both Java backends rather than written out twice: the
# wrapper belongs to Maven, not to whatever owns startup above it, so the two siblings cannot disagree
