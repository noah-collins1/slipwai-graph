"""`slipwai converge`: the end of an adoption — every row of the map reads *as generated*, so the delivery material
moves from `layout.delivery` to the root as one merge, and the repository is a generated one from then on.

Brownfield adoption (experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word) starts wherever the repository is and
climbs one rung per slice. This is the verb for the day nothing on the map differs from a generated project. It
is `migrate` with the layout moved: the replay is assembled for the root, the base's files are taken out from
under the delivery directory, and the merge carries the move; then what the factory does not list in `.written`
but wrote or kept under the delivery directory — the survey, the ledgers, the ratchet baseline, a person's ADRs —
is moved with `git mv`, the marked blocks in `AGENTS.md` and `.gitignore` are respelled for the root, and the
harness projections are re-derived. `origin: adopted` stays, with the survey and the map, as history.

`--check` says whether the repository is ready and why not: a row below its target, a row the tree contradicts
(`check-convergence`), a file at the root the move would write over — a `Makefile` of the repository's own is the
usual one — an unclean tree. Nothing is moved on a refusal, and the refusal is the report.
