"""`slipwai adopt --confirm`: a candidate becomes an application, and everything the record drives follows.

Brownfield adoption (#74; experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word), under [ADR 0003](../../docs/adr/
0003-a-wrapped-application-begins-as-a-candidate.md). `adopt` records every buildable directory the survey
found as a candidate and wraps none of them, because which of them is an application — and what it is called,
and what it owns — are questions the code answers and a terminal cannot ask well. This is where the answer
arrives: from `/ground`, with the code in front of the agent, or from a person who already knows.

It is a command rather than an instruction to edit `project.json`, for the reason `add-service` is one. The
manifest is the thing every generated file reads, so an entry with a mistyped target or a `kind` the factory
does not know is a repository whose gate fails in a way nobody can see the cause of. Here the entry is built
by the factory from the candidate the survey recorded, validated, and then `resurvey.refresh` regenerates
everything that reads it — the Makefile with the application's build in the gate, CI, the docs, the map.

Declining is the other half and is deliberately plain: the candidate is dropped, nothing is recorded in its
place, and a later `/survey` reports the directory as one that builds and has no record, which is what it is.
