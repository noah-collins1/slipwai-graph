"""The convergence map: where an adopted repository stands on each ladder a generated project sits at the top of.

A generated project starts at the top of every ladder and the method keeps it there. A repository the method
was installed around (brownfield adoption; experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word) starts wherever
it is, and the loop's job is to climb one rung per slice until the two are the same thing. This is the record
of where it is: one row per axis — `rung`, the `target` a generated project sits at, the `evidence`, where the
row came from, and what slice is `planned` to move it. Written by `adopt` from what the survey and the person
established, refreshed by `adopt --refresh` under the provenance rule every other fact follows, rendered as
`docs/convergence.md`, and held by `scripts/check-convergence.py`, which fails a row the tree contradicts.

Nothing here is a default that looks like an answer. A rung is claimed only from a fact the record holds — a
recorded test command, a declared layout, a release path a file or a person gave — and a rung nothing
establishes reads as the ladder's floor with `unrecorded` provenance, which the gate passes with a line and
`/drive` asks about. A person moves a row by editing `project.json`; the provenance then says so.
