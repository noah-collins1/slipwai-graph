"""`adopt`: install the delivery method around a repository that already exists — Survey, then Wrap.

Brownfield adoption (experimental), experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word. The factory's other verbs make a
repository or grow one they made; this one is run at the root of somebody else's and adds the method beside
their code: the gate, CI for it, the skills, commands and documentation, the agent projections, and a
`project.json` that records what was here — detected by the survey, confirmed or overridden by the person —
rather than what was chosen.

What it writes is what `scaffold.project_files` assembles for an adopted project, under `layout.delivery`,
cut to what such a repository takes (`project/adopted.py`); what it appends is a marked block to `AGENTS.md`
and to `.gitignore`, once, and `.claude/settings.json` where there is none. Nothing of the repository's own
is written over, and the whole of it is one commit by the factory, which is how `replay` finds its base the
next time. Refused: a directory that is not a Git repository (`git init` is day zero, not a workaround), an
unclean tree, and a repository that already has a `project.json` — `slipwai migrate` brings that one forward.
