"""The Makefile's integration suites: the variables one backing service's tests need, and the targets that run them.

Split out of `makefile.py` when it reached its budget. `test-integration` and `ci` differ with and without a
real backing service, and both are spelled once, with the difference held in a variable that has a `?=`
fallback — a marked block per branch cannot work, because a prune only ever subtracts and the branch cut at
generation time is gone for good. One variable per application: `INTEGRATION_TEST` for the first,
`INTEGRATION_TEST_<NAME>` after, each in its own store's marked region, and a store's own variables (the
database address) once however many services use it. The applications that existed before the method did
are on the same list, with the integration command their build recorded (`native_commands.gated`).
