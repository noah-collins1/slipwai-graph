"""The stop table: every stop `/drive` makes, what `/cruise` does there instead, and where the answer is recorded.

Split from `cruise.py` because that module is at its budget, and because the table is the one part of the
command that varies with what the project is — the release rows only under a production target, the gaps
row reading the profile's own artifact, three more rows in an adopted repository — so it is the part most
often read on its own. The two paths the runner and the audit write, `LOG` and `REPORT`, live here because
the table is the first thing that names them; `cruise.py` re-exports both.
