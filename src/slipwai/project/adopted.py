"""What a repository the factory did not make takes from it, and the pages and blocks that explain the adoption.

`scaffold.project_files` assembles the whole of a project as if the factory had made it; this cuts that set

the word). Three root files are the repository's own and never claimed — `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,

a marked block, appended once by `adopt` and left alone by `replay`, which regenerates only what is listed in
`<layout.delivery>/.written`: the paths it wrote, so that a newer factory can tell what to replace in a tree
that is mostly not its own. The CI workflow is `verify-delivery.yml`, beside whatever CI the repository runs,
and sets up the toolchains the wrapped applications recorded rather than the ones the catalog knows.

{EXPERIMENTAL}

`{project_name}` existed before this method did. `slipwai adopt` surveyed the tree, proposed what it found, and
wrote the method's material under `{where(layout)}` beside the code — nothing of the repository's own was
written over, and `project.json` records every fact with where it came from: `detected` from the tree,
`confirmed` by the person who accepted it, `overridden` by the person who changed it.{why}{converged_paragraph(adoption)}

## What was wrapped

{applications}

## Where the rest lives

{home_paragraph("The database schema", adoption.database, "schema")}

{home_paragraph("The deployment infrastructure", adoption.infrastructure, "home")}

Neither is something the factory manages here: `adopt` owns no environment and applies nothing. Where either
is `here`, the rule is import or reference — never manage a resource in two places. Where it is `elsewhere`,
the other repository is the contract. Where it is `unmanaged`, the finding is written down and the first step
is named.

## What runs

`{make} verify` is the gate: the method's own checks — agent projections, Spec Kit, the constitution floor,
the import rule over anything the factory generates — and then every wrapped application's recorded commands,
in the order above. A target recorded `null` passes with a line saying so; it is a written no, not a gap to
fill by guessing. `lint` and `typecheck` run through the ratchet (`{where(layout)}scripts/ratchet.py`): the
first local run records the findings that are there into `{where(layout)}baseline.json` — commit it — and
from then on the gate fails only on a finding that is new; `make ratchet-tighten` re-records what is left once
somebody has looked. `test` runs through the same ratchet with one difference: a suite that is red on day one
stops the first run and says so — a red suite is a fact a person reads, never one the gate records behind them —
and `make ratchet-tighten`, once they have, records it as **quarantined**: the gate passes on the state it
recorded and says so every run, until the suite is green and `ratchet-tighten` clears it. A new failure is still
a failure, whether the output names a file at a position or the runner names the test (`--- FAIL: TestX`,
`not ok 3 - adds`, `FAILED tests/test_a.py::test_b`, Surefire's `[ERROR]   ShopTest.adds`). `smoke` is the one
command the gate cannot compose from the eight: the application started and proved to answer, recorded as
`commands.smoke` once `{where(layout)}survey/running.md` says how (`/ground` asks; `null` is a written no with
its reason there). `{make} smoke` runs it, `{make} ci` and the gate's own smoke job run it in CI, and `verify`
never does, since it needs what the application needs. A Maven or Gradle build runs through its wrapper
(`./mvnw`, `./gradlew`): where the repository had none, `adopt` wrote one beside the build file, so the machine
needs a JDK and no Maven or Gradle of its own. Any other recorded command whose tool is not on the machine
running it cannot be baselined — the ratchet fails, names the tool, and records nothing until it is installed or
`project.json` records what this machine does run. A suite recorded as `test-full` is too slow for the gate and
has a target of its own. {ci_paragraph(adoption, layout)}

## How a change reaches production

{release_paragraph(adoption)}

## Next

1. `./{where(layout)}init` — first, as in any project the factory made. It installs Spec Kit and asks which
   coding agent to project the skills and commands into (`./{where(layout)}init --integration claude` names it
   outright; `python3 {where(layout)}scripts/agents/project.py --list` shows every agent it knows).
   `./{where(layout)}init --extension codegraph` indexes the code, which is what makes a legacy codebase safe
   for an agent to work in; the two flags go together in one run.
2. `/ground`, in the agent — the question set the tree could not answer: one row of
   `{where(layout)}docs/convergence.md` at a time, the evidence and the rungs shown first, each answer written
   with `confirmed` provenance; then `/survey` so the pages and the strategy recommendation follow. What
   the tree could not say, or `--yes` left `unrecorded`, is settled here rather than one slice at a time —
   or skip straight to `/drive`, whose Ground stage runs the same questions for the rows a slice touches.
3. `{make} verify` — green on day one is the promise for a linter or type checker that arrived after the
   code, and the first run records the ratchet baseline: commit `{where(layout)}baseline.json` with what `init`
   wrote. A test suite that is red on day one is the one exception: the run stops and says so, and
   `{make} ratchet-tighten` quarantines it once you have read the failures. Anything else not green is the
   repository's own command failing, and `project.json` is where to correct what the survey got wrong.
4. {makefile_step}
5. Read `{where(layout)}docs/convergence.md`: where this repository stands on every ladder a generated project
   sits at the top of, what is planned to move each row, and what nobody has established yet; and
   `{where(layout)}survey/structure.md`, the architecture view — where anything starts, what depends on what,
   where change happens — which says what moves the Structure row and where `/strangle` would cut. Then
   `{where(layout)}docs/getting-started.md` and `{where(layout)}docs/architecture.md`, then `/drive`,
   whose ladder here begins at *Ground* (no map, no principles), pins wrapped code before *Implementation*,
   and holds the map to each slice at *Convergence* before offering the next row as a method slice.
   Three more commands are this adoption's own: `/characterise` pins the current behaviour of the code a slice is about
   to change, at the seam where it can be observed (`{where(layout)}survey/pinned.md` is the ledger) — with
   fakes written in the test tree, never a mocking framework it would have to add — and
   `/survey` runs `slipwai adopt --refresh` to reconcile a fresh survey with what `project.json` records.
   How each application is *run* is written, once proven, in `{where(layout)}survey/running.md` — the
   repository's own file, which the `run-the-app` skill points to and the factory never rewrites.
   When the code is ready to move, `{where(layout)}docs/change-strategy.md` opens with the strategy `why` and
   the map recommend for this repository — *leave it* included — then the three strategies and the order to
   change in; an accepted ADR with a `Strategy:` line is the decision, and `/strangle` moves one capability
   at a time only under a decision that says `strangler-fig`, writing `{where(layout)}retirement.md` as it goes.
6. Merge this adoption alone, before the first slice, and from then on one pull request per slice — a slice's
   after-acceptance commits ride in its own PR. A reviewer can read a slice; nobody reads five at once.
7. Later, `slipwai migrate` brings a newer factory's material here as one merge; the files it wrote are listed
   in `{where(layout)}{WRITTEN}`, and nothing else is ever touched.

Profiles, axes and everything else the factory offers a generated project are described in
`{where(layout)}docs/`; `{', '.join(CATALOG['backends'])}` are the backends it can add beside what is here.

## Delivery method (installed by slipwai {version}; experimental)

This repository adopted the factory's delivery method: its material lives under `{where(layout)}`, beside
the code, and `project.json` records what was here and what was confirmed about it. Read
`{where(layout)}docs/adoption.md` first, then `{where(layout)}docs/convergence.md` — where this repository
stands on each ladder a generated project sits at the top of; a rung is claimed only from a fact, an
`unrecorded` row is a question to ask, and `project.json`'s `convergence` is where an answer is written. The
gate is `{layout.make} verify`; the skills are under
`{where(layout)}skills/` and the commands under `{where(layout)}commands/` (`{layout.make} agents`
projects them into your harness). The rules in `{where(layout)}docs/architecture.md` bind code the factory
generates; existing code is held to its own recorded commands and to nothing it did not have before. Change
what `project.json` says only by editing it deliberately, and never edit anything listed in
`{where(layout)}{WRITTEN}` by hand — those files are the factory's, and `slipwai migrate` replaces them.

**Tests written here** — for new code and for code that was here alike — stand in at a seam with a fake
written in the test tree, a class or function implementing the real interface, never with a mocking framework
this repository would have to add: Mockito, Moq, gomock, `unittest.mock` and `jest.mock` are the same last
resort in every language, and "what should I add?" is never answered with one. Where the test framework that
was here is out of support — JUnit 3 or 4, nose, a runner nobody maintains — new tests use the ecosystem's
*current* framework and keep the old tests running beside them (JUnit 5 through its vintage engine; pytest
runs `unittest` suites as they are), as a slice on the map's Platform row: never the next-oldest version,
never an upgrade decided in passing.

**One pull request per slice.** The adoption commit merges alone, before any slice; each slice is its own pull
request, and a slice's after-acceptance commits — the adversary pass, the archive — ride in its own PR, never
the next one's. A first PR of five slices and 566 files was reviewed by nobody, and a framework's major version
moved inside it unseen.
