"""What `make mutation` does per backend, and why — the prose the generated Makefile carries.

Split out of `backends.py` for the reason `service_layouts.py` was split out of `backing_services.py`:
this is most of the bytes and none of the behaviour, and it is read only by the two modules that build
the Makefile — `project/native_commands.py` for the recipes, `project/makefile.py` for the notes beside
them. It belongs beside those readers rather than in the per-backend contract, the same way every other
piece of generated prose in this package does.

Three notes and one placeholder, keyed per backend rather than per family, and that distinction is
load-bearing here. `make mutation` is run by no gate in a generated project, and by the factory's only for
Go (docs/backend-obligations.md section 2), so what these say is most of what stands between the next
reader and a score they should not trust — and the two Java backends genuinely disagree, because PIT works
under Spring Boot's test harness and times out under Quarkus's.

# The script `make mutation` runs Gremlins through, written once per project by `languages/go.py` from the
# asset of the same name. It exists because of two things verified against 0.6.0 on 2026-09-09 (the marches
# review of the Gremlins migration raised the first):
#
#   1. Gremlins copies the module it mutates — the nearest go.mod upwards, never the workspace — to a
#      temporary directory and tests there, where no `go.work` and no `packages/<name>` exist. A service
#      that imports a shared module the way `guidance.py` tells it to cannot build in that copy, and
#      Gremlins scores the build failure as KILLED because `go test` exits 1 for a failed build and a failed
#      test alike: every mutant in the importing package "killed", 100% efficacy, exit 0, with a test that
#      could not fail. The script stages the service beside the workspace modules it imports, with an
#      absolute `replace` for each, and runs with GOWORK=off.
#   2. Gremlins passes two runs the Spring backend's `failWhenNoMutations` would fail: a module with nothing
#      to mutate ("No results to report.", exit 0), and a run whose mutants timed out — a timed-out mutant is
#      left out of the score, and at the default coefficient half the skeleton's were. The script fails both.
#
# It carries two more things, both verified against 0.6.0 on 2026-09-21. It copies the report out of the
# staging tree before deleting it, so the target leaves evidence rather than a scrollback. And it takes
# `--since <ref>`, scoping the run to the production files that differ from that ref by generating the
# complement of exclusions — because Gremlins' own `--diff` is unusable from a module in a subdirectory: it
# resolves changed paths against the repository root, matches them against paths within the module, finds no
# overlap, and reports every mutant SKIPPED and the run successful. That is the shape of failure this backend
# keeps producing, so it is named here rather than discovered again.

# Wired up: Gremlins, pinned to a release and run through `go run` by `scripts/go-mutation.py`, so it is
# never a dependency of the module it mutates. It needs Go 1.25 or newer; an older `go` with the default
# GOTOOLCHAIN=auto downloads one for the run. It replaced go-mutesting, whose 2019 package loader crashed on

# The script stages the service beside the workspace modules it imports before Gremlins runs. Gremlins
# copies only the module it mutates to a temporary directory — no `go.work` above it, no `packages/<name>`
# beside it — and scores the build failure that follows as a kill, because `go test` exits 1 for a failed
# build and a failed test alike: run naked on a service that imports shared code it reported every such
# mutant killed, 100% efficacy and a green target, with tests that could not fail. The staged copy gets a
# `require` and an absolute `replace` per imported module and runs with GOWORK=off. The shared module is
# built there and never mutated; run this against it as a service of its own if its rules need a gate.
#
# The report lands at `__APP__/gremlins.json`, copied out of that staging tree before it is deleted, and is
# ignored by git: it is one run on one machine, and the next run replaces it. It is written whether the run
# passed or failed, because a red run's report is the one worth reading.
#
# `make mutation` scopes itself on a `slice/<id>` branch, to the production files that differ from the trunk commit
# the branch was cut from — staged, unstaged and untracked ones included, nothing committed or stashed to run it —
# and `make mutation SINCE=<branch-or-commit>` does the same against that ref on any checkout, CI included. CI, the
# trunk and a checkout the script cannot read run the sweep, `make mutation-full`, which is also what an empty
# `SINCE` runs. That is the difference between a stage priced per repository and one priced per change: every
# mutant costs a run of this module's suite, so a sweep re-proves every file that shipped weeks ago at full price,
# and a stage that expensive gets routed around rather than read. Phase 4 on `main` runs `make mutation SINCE=<the
# commit before the merge>`, so the check is priced by the change that merged. A change to `__APP__/.gremlins.yaml` or to
# `scripts/go-mutation.py` sweeps the service, since no scope can be trusted across it; a change to the `mutation` or
# `mutation-full` rule, or a `mutation-full` recipe that is not the one the factory wrote, makes the whole run the sweep,
# and that recipe runs as written. The scope is computed from
# git before staging, not handed to Gremlins' own `--diff`:
# `--diff` resolves changed paths against the repository root and matches them against paths within the
# module, so from a service directory it skips every mutant and reports success having mutated nothing. Gremlins has no
# include list either, so a scope is a complement of exclusions, generated per run — and since
# `--exclude-files` replaces the yaml's list rather than adding to it, the script reads that list and passes
# it back rather than dropping the exclusions below.
#
# The gate is in `__APP__/.gremlins.yaml`, not on this line: a run with a surviving mutant fails. The
# value there is 99.99 and it lives in a file for two reasons the file records — in Gremlins 0.6.0 the
# `--threshold-efficacy` flag and the GREMLINS_* environment variables are read as strings and silently
# gate nothing, and a threshold of 100 fails a perfect run because the comparison is `<=`. A recipe that
# grows a `--threshold` flag here gates nothing; change the file.
#
# The scope is that file's `integration: true` — Gremlins' word for running the whole module's tests against
# every mutant and gathering coverage across packages, so domain code that only an adapter's tests reach is
# covered and mutated rather than reported "not covered". It is not Go's `-tags=integration`: no run here
# sets that tag, so a test behind it is `make test-integration`'s, and a store adapter is mutated only as far
# as its in-process tests reach. Only mutants a test reaches are run — "not covered" is reported, never
# failed — so this fails on a weak test and not on a missing one; `make test`'s coverage gate
# (`scripts/go-coverage.py`) is where the missing one fails.
#
# Two runs Gremlins passes are red here, for the reason `failWhenNoMutations` is true in the Spring
# service's pom — a silent pass on a target no gate runs is worse than a red one. A run that found nothing
# to mutate ("No results to report.", exit 0) exits 1. And a timed-out mutant, which Gremlins leaves out of
# the score, fails the run: the fix is `timeout-coefficient` in the yaml, not a lower threshold.
#
# A survivor is a test to write or an equivalent mutant. Gremlins excludes files, not mutants, so an
# equivalent mutant means lowering the threshold deliberately, named in the commit that lowers it. No gate
# in this repository runs this target (docs/backend-obligations.md section 2); the factory's own suite runs
# it once, on a service importing a workspace module, to hold the staging to what this note says.
# `/mutation` runs it after an accepted slice and classifies what it reports.

# What `make mutation` does on the Quarkus backend, and why it is not PIT already wired up.
#
# Per backend rather than per family, and the Spring sibling is the reason: PIT *is* wired up there, so a
# note shared across the family would tell one of the two something flatly untrue about its own build.
#
# PIT is the ecosystem's mutation tester and pitest-junit5-plugin 1.2.3 is the first version claiming
# Quarkus support — so the tool is not in doubt. What is in doubt is running it over a `@QuarkusTest`:
# pitest issue #1287 reports tests that pass standalone timing out on every mutation under PIT, on the
# configuration that behaves fine for Spring Boot — which is the one `java-spring` in this same factory
# ships wired up. That is exactly the failure this factory could not
# catch, because `make mutation` is run by no gate at either level (docs/backend-obligations.md section 2),
# so a wired-up PIT would have been committed green and stayed green.
#
# The mitigation is real and is written down below rather than guessed at later: mutate the domain, which
# is framework-free by construction here, with its plain JUnit tests — and keep `@QuarkusTest` and `*IT`
# out of PIT's reach. That is a decision about which classes this product considers worth mutating, which
# is why it is a decision the project makes rather than one the factory pins.
JAVA_QUARKUS_MUTATION_NOTE = """\
# Not wired up, on purpose, and the reason is a support constraint rather than a missing dependency.
#
# PIT is the JVM's mutation tester, and pitest-junit5-plugin 1.2.3 is the first version that claims
# Quarkus support. But pitest issue #1287 reports `@QuarkusTest` classes that pass standalone timing out
# on every mutation once PIT runs them — the same configuration works for Spring Boot, which is why the
# `java-spring` backend here ships `make mutation` wired up and this one does not. Nothing in this
# repository's gates runs this target, so a broken configuration here would never fail a build; it would
# just quietly never have worked.
#
# So configure it deliberately, and narrowly:
#
#   1. targetClasses — the domain packages only. They are framework-free by construction, which is the
#      whole reason the hexagon puts them there, and they are where a surviving mutant means something.
#   2. targetTests — the plain JUnit tests over those packages. Exclude `@QuarkusTest` and every `*IT`.
#   3. pitest-junit5-plugin as a dependency of the pitest-maven *plugin*, not of the project. Declared as
#      a project dependency, PIT reports "0 tests found" and does nothing, which is the most common way a
#      first PIT setup silently passes.
#
# Then run it, look at the survivors, and only afterwards let anything depend on the score.

# Wired up and scoped, and the scope is the part to read before trusting a score.
#
# PIT mutates the packages named in `pitest-maven`'s `targetClasses` in `__APP__/pom.xml` — the
# domain, the ports, the URL parser and the group mapping — and runs the plain `*Test` classes over them.
# That is deliberate on both sides:
#
#   1. Those packages are framework-free by construction, which is the whole reason the hexagon puts them
#      there, and they are where a surviving mutant means a rule nothing checks.
#   2. `*IT` is excluded. PIT runs the tests once per mutant, so a database suite in scope would turn a
#      minutes-long run into an hours-long one, for coverage of wiring rather than of rules.
#   3. Two classes inside those packages are excluded by name — `SecurityConfig` and the
#      `EnvironmentPostProcessor`. They are how a decision gets plugged into Spring rather than the
#      decision, so their mutants survive by nature: killing one would mean asserting Spring's own wiring.
#
# The report lands in `target/pit-reports/`. It fails rather than passes when it finds nothing to mutate,
# which is deliberate: `failWhenNoMutations` is `true` in the pom because "0 mutations" here can only mean
# a misconfigured run, and a silent pass on a target no gate runs is worse than a red one. A scoped run is the
# exception: `make mutation` scopes itself on a `slice/<id>` branch, and `make mutation SINCE=<ref>` does the same on
# any checkout, narrowing PIT to the changed classes, `Foo` and `Foo$*`, within the targets above; a class PIT finds
# nothing to mutate in (an interface, a record with no logic) is reported as no mutant to run, not as a failure.
# `make mutation-full` is the sweep, unchanged, and CI and the trunk get the sweep, as does a change to the `mutation`
# or `mutation-full` rule; a `mutation-full` recipe that is not the one the factory wrote also makes the whole run the
# sweep, and it runs as written. Phase 4 on `main` runs `make mutation SINCE=<the commit before the merge>`.
#
# So a clean run here does NOT mean the adapters are well tested; it means the rules are. Widen
# `targetClasses` as use cases arrive, and leave the adapters out — their tests are about wiring, and
# mutating wiring mostly produces survivors nobody should act on.
