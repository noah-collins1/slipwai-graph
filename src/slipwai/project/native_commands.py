"""What each backend runs for the eight targets the Makefile is built from, per service.

One table, keyed by backend, because the answer is pure data: which command installs, lints, tests or
audits a service is the same command whatever else the selection contains — and the same command for every
service, spelled with `APP` where the service's path goes. It sits apart from `makefile.py` for the reason
`service_layouts.py` sits apart from `backing_services.py` — the table is most of the bytes and none of the
assembly, and a module holding both outgrows what anybody wants to read at once. `makefile.py` had grown
past check-structure's module budget saying exactly that.

The keys are the contract: every backend answers all eight, `docs/backend-obligations.md` documents them
row for row, and `tests/test_backend_obligations.py` fails until a new backend answers each one. The
contract is owed *per service*: `native_commands` asks it of every service in the project and merges the
answers into one recipe per target.
