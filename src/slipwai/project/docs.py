`make verify` is the deterministic local and CI entry point. It runs {gate}{(" plus Biome, TypeScript and React component tests for " + web_paths if web else "")}, architecture direction,
agent-projection and Spec Kit manifest drift, constitution coverage, event-model validation in the event profile,
and `check-benchmark`, which warns of a benchmark entry left open or a done slice with no record, and
keeps missing measurements visibly unbracketed. `make help` lists integration,
adversarial, mutation, model, benchmark and dependency-audit targets. Mutation and dependency audit remain
explicit end-of-phase/CI operations, not hidden costs in every local increment.

`make check-codegraph` is in the gate for a project that has adopted a code index and a no-op for one that
has not: it fails when `.codegraph/` no longer describes the tracked source — files it has never seen, or
files that changed after it read them. CodeGraph indexes only while a client is attached to its daemon, so a
checkout opened where that tooling is missing keeps a database nothing updates, and a stale index answers
*nothing calls that* in the same words an accurate one uses. The failure says how to catch it up.
On a `slice/<id>` branch in a developer's checkout, outside CI, the gate compares only what changed since its last
whole comparison and leaves the integrity check to the trunk and CI; it keeps that record in
`.codegraph/gate-memory.json` (ignored by Git), and deleting that file makes the next run whole.
{style_gate}{production_gate}
`make check-constitution` is the one gate that reads a document rather than code, and it waits for the
document: `./init` installs the constitution *template*, and while that file is still the untouched template
the gate reports that nothing has been drafted and passes, so the commit `./init` pushes goes through
`verify` before a principle has been written. From the first edit — and regardless, once any feature exists
under `specs/` — it applies in full: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` must carry minimum CD, the practices the skills in
{coverage_scope}

`make constitution-requirements` prints the normative text and `/constitution-coverage` runs the same check
from an agent session. Amend the constitution rather than the gate: a principle deleted from that file is a
gate that silently stopped existing, because every later phase reads it as the authority it claims to be.

Minimum CD here follows [MinimumCD](https://minimumcd.org/minimumcd/) (CC BY-SA 4.0), restated for this
repository and extended with the clause on agent-generated change; `skills/REFERENCES.md` records what was
taken and what was added.

Tests should protect observable behaviour. Keep fast domain tests focused, add adapter contract tests at
real boundaries, and add end-to-end tests only for paths whose integration risk justifies them.

{diagram}

For one small vertical slice:

1. {discovery.capitalize()}.
2. Run `/gaps` over what that produced, while a missing state is still a paper edit.
3. Create or resume `plan.md` and `tasks.md` with the Spec Kit commands installed by `./init`.
4. Implement each task RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, keeping `make verify` green.
5. Run the installed Spec Kit converge command, implement whatever it appends, and repeat until it reports
   converged or reaches its bound; then `/gaps` over the slice diff.
6. Demonstrate the actor-visible path and pause for feedback.
7. After acceptance, run `/mutation` and `make verify` — and `/adversary` first, when the slice changed
   attack surface or closed the split.

The principles stage has a gate of its own. `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is what every stage after it
treats as the authority, so `make check-constitution` fails the build when that file stops carrying minimum
CD, the practices the skills in `skills/` teach, or the obligations this project's capabilities claim — and
`.specify/extensions.yml` hooks `/speckit-constitution` on both sides so the drafting session sees the
required coverage before writing and the check runs immediately after. `/constitution-coverage` prints the
normative text at any time. Until that stage has been started the gate stands aside: `./init` installs the
template, and the untouched template passes, so the walking skeleton reaches `main` — and production, where
there is a target — before the first principle is written. It applies from the first edit, and from the first
feature under `specs/` whether or not the constitution was touched.

Three stages in the loop are deliberately not the shape they look like. **Converge** is append-only — its
only write is new tasks — so it is safe to repeat until it reports converged or reaches its bound, and it is what makes the demo
worth showing. The **second `/gaps`** runs after that verdict rather than before it, because ahead of
converge every unbuilt task reads as a gap and buries the findings that need judgement. **`/adversary`** is
an end-of-phase pass rather than a per-slice one: `commands/adversary.md` runs it when the diff changed
attack surface and at the close of the split regardless, and records the decision either way in
`specs/<feature>/adversary-log.md` — which is what lets a later slice decline on evidence instead of
judgement. The trigger table is in that row before any spawn. `/mutation` still runs on every accepted slice, and when both run adversary goes first, since it
adds tests and mutation measures whatever exists when it runs.

`/drive` owns resumption and sequencing, and is safe to call at any point on this diagram: it enters at the
first stage still owing an artifact, stepping back out of the loop when an upstream stage has not been done.
Demo feedback returns to the stage that owns the change before the path is demonstrated again. A real product decision is a stop; finishing an intermediate document is
not.

`/cruise` runs this same diagram with nobody at the wheel. A product decision is answered by `drive-skipper`
and written in `specs/<feature>/decisions.md`; the demo is run by `drive-hand` and written in the slice's
`demo-log.md`; the run ends only when the specification is satisfied, or when a person stops it. What each
stage produces does not change. `commands/cruise.md` is exact.
