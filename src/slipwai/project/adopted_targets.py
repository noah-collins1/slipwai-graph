"""The Make targets an adopted repository has and a generated project does not, appended to the delivery Makefile.

Brownfield adoption (experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word). Three of them: `check-convergence` and
`ratchet-tighten`, the map's gate and the ratchet's re-recording; `smoke`, each application that existed before
the method did started by the command it recorded and proved to answer — the one thing the day-one gate cannot
compose from the eight recorded commands, run by `ci` and by a job of its own in the gate's workflow and never by
`verify`, since it needs what the application needs; and `test-full` where a suite too slow for `verify` was
recorded. Split from `adopted.py` when the smoke target took the pages and the targets together past the module
budget, the way `adopted_ci.py` was.
