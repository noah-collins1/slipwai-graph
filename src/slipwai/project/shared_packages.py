"""The npm workspace: `node_modules`, `packages/`, and what has to be true for either to work.

A generated project starts with an empty `packages/` and the documentation to fill it — `docs/architecture.md`
says what a shared package is in each language family. This module is the npm half of that promise, which is
the half with a build step: a workspace package emits declarations its consumers import, its `dist/` is not
committed, and so a fresh checkout has none. Four things have to hold, and they are spelled here together
because they are one decision:

- the root `package.json` lists `packages/*` as a workspace, so `npm --workspace packages/<name>` resolves;
- `node_modules/.package-lock.json` is a target that runs `npm ci`, and nothing else in the Makefile runs one;
- `make build-packages` builds every package under it that declares a build script;
- every target that compiles or runs this project's own *npm* code takes those targets as *prerequisites*.

The prerequisite is the part worth insisting on, and it is the same argument twice. A step remembered inside
each recipe is a step that will one day be forgotten in one of them, and that target then passes on a machine
where `dist/` happens to exist and fails in CI — which is exactly how the omission was found downstream. One
line naming every target that needs it cannot be forgotten in one of them. The install had the opposite
failure: it was remembered in *every* recipe, as a guard before every npm line, which is the same decision
copied sixteen times in a default project and re-copied with each recipe added. Make already knows how to run
a thing once per invocation and skip it when it is up to date; a file target says so in one place.

Only the npm family has this problem: a Go module under `packages/` is compiled on demand inside the
workspace, a Python package is installed in place, and the Java answer (an aggregator pom) is the day a
shared module arrives, which `SHARED_CODE` in `rules.py` says where a reader of the generated project will look for it.
