    """What Claude Code runs around compaction and at the end of a turn, so a `/cruise` iteration resumes
    from its checkpoint and cannot end anywhere but on one of its four last lines — and around a search and a
    delegate, so the code index is asked before the source is grepped for a symbol and is current after.

    `SessionStart` with the `compact` matcher runs when the session continues after compaction and its
    stdout is added to the context; `PreCompact` runs just before. `Stop` runs when the model tries to end
    its turn, and a hook there can refuse: `stopping` does, in a session the runner started, while a
    checkpoint says an iteration is in flight and the turn's last line is not an end the contract knows —
    the one control a command file's prose is not. All three call the cruise script, which does nothing
    unless a runner's iteration is in flight, so a plain `/drive` session, and a typed `/cruise` (which
    starts the runner and ends), never see them. The other harnesses' equivalents, where one exists, are the
    registry's `compaction` and `hooks` rows, and `scripts/agents/project.py` writes those hook files.

# What the delivery loop runs in every project whatever its language: the toolkit's own scripts — every verb of
# `scripts/agents/cruise.py`, the projections, the gates — and the Git a slice is made of. A session that cannot
# ask is refused every command its rules do not name, and one refused first command parks a `/cruise` run before
# its first stage: a TypeScript project's first iteration could not run `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py loop`,
# its allowlist having no `python3` rule. The headless iteration is now given the shell wholesale by the
# registry's row (`--allowedTools Bash`), because no list can name the compound commands an agent writes; these
# rules are what keep a person's own session from prompting at every hook and gate, and the deny rules below
# are what hold in both. Resets and cleans are absent, and a plain force-push is denied rather than merely
# unlisted, because `git push *` would otherwise admit it: they destroy work.
# `git push *` itself has to stay, because the ladder's own push after a rebase is the lease-guarded one,
# `git push --force-with-lease=refs/heads/slice/<id>: origin HEAD:...`, which a narrower prefix could not name.
