"""The three records `/cruise` writes in a fixed shape: a decision, a demo, and the checkpoint a compacted context resumes from.

Their shapes live here, apart from the command that shows them and the brief that repeats them, because
three things are written from them — `commands/cruise.md`, the owner brief, and the `check-decisions` gate's
expectations — and a shape stated once cannot drift between them. The checkpoint is the newest: a context can
be summarised by the harness at any point, and what a summary loses is the state nothing on disk carries —
which delegates are out, a question half-answered, which slice's demo comes next — so the command keeps that
in one small file and re-reads it, and the harnesses that can run a command after compaction replay it.

**A decision that outlives its slice is also an ADR.** Ask the `architecture-decisions` skill's one question
of every entry, host-decided or skipper-decided: would reversing it cost a migration rather than a refactor —
an event's schema or name, stream identity, tenancy, the store, personal data, identity, a new dependency, a
published contract? Where it would, write `docs/adr/NNNN-<title>.md` in Nygard's five sections at `Proposed` —
the run never accepts its own architecture decision — with the next unused number, allocated here the way
`D<n>` is, and name it in the entry's `Written to` beside the artifact. The entry is the log of what was
decided; the ADR is where the next slice looks for why, and `{REPORT}` lists every ADR still `Proposed`."""
