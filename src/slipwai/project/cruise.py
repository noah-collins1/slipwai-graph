# Cruise

`/drive` takes one slice from wherever it stands to an actor-visible demo and stops for a product decision, an
unavailable input, an exhausted split and the demo. This command runs **that ladder — `commands/drive.md`,
every rule as written** — with nobody at the wheel: it decides what the ladder would have asked a person,
runs each demo as the actor, and re-enters the ladder until the specification under `specs/<feature>/` is
satisfied. Nothing about what a stage produces changes; what changes is who answers. It stops for a human and
for nothing else. An iteration is one invocation of this command; the outer loop that re-invokes it with a
fresh context is `python3 {SCRIPT} run` (`{layout.make} cruise`), on every harness. Typed in a session, nothing
re-invokes it, so the command starts that loop instead of running the ladder here (*Before anything*, below):
the runner is the one thing that continues a run, whatever the harness.{adopted}

## Before anything: refuse, or start

Read `{CONFIG}`. `enabled: false`, or `{STOP_FILE}` present, is a refusal in one line that says which. No
`specs/<feature>/spec.md` is a refusal too: a specification is the one thing a person brings. In an iteration a
refusal still ends on a last line, because the runner reads nothing else and would spend its stuck budget on a
plain one: `enabled: false` or the stop file ends on `{LAST_LINES[3]}` — a person turned it off — and a missing
specification on `cruise: parked: a specification under specs/<feature>/spec.md`; typed in a session, the
refusal is plain, since nothing reads it. Then run
`python3 {SCRIPT} loop`: it says what is reading this session's last line. **Where it says nobody is** — this
command was typed in a session, and no runner set `CRUISE_RUNNER` and `CRUISE_ITERATION` — run
`python3 {SCRIPT} start` with everything typed after `/cruise` as its arguments, verbatim, and repeat what it
printed: the runner it started drives the ladder from here, one fresh session per iteration, and this session
runs no stage of it. A refusal is the whole answer — a runner already running, the stop file present, no
harness on PATH it can run an iteration through. Then take the watch seat (*The watch seat*, below). **Where
it says the outer loop started this session**, this is an iteration: read the owner brief (`{OWNER_BRIEF}`)
and every standing entry in `{DECISIONS}` (a slice's question reads those `{SCOPE_VERB}` prints; a
feature-level one reads all), and say the iteration number from `{LOG}`, the branch and its distance from
trunk, and that a person stops this run with `touch {STOP_FILE}`. Where `.codegraph/` is in the
tree, the runner has already opened, checked and synced it for this iteration: a caller or blast-radius question
is one call — `scripts/codegraph callers <symbol>`, or `codegraph_explore` — and `python3 {SCRIPT} status`
counts, per delegate, who asked it and who searched the source for a symbol first. Open a `skipper`, `hand` or `bosun`
benchmark entry around each delegation the way every stage is bracketed, and
pass `driver=cruise` to every `end` this iteration closes.

**The argument is the kick-off.** What a person typed after `/cruise` — what this run is for, where the brief
or the PRD is, which feature — reaches the first iteration of the run and no other: every later iteration
runs bare and derives its stage from disk. So the first iteration writes down whatever the kick-off says that
must outlive it — a PRD it names becomes the specification through the ladder's own stages, a preference it
states goes into the owner brief (`{OWNER_BRIEF}`), a scope it sets is a decision entry — before it does
anything else. Two things the runner passes itself recur: a feature named with `--feature` on `run` or `start`
(`{layout.make} cruise FEATURE=<name>`) is the first word of every iteration's argument and scopes the run to that
feature's specification — the ladder is entered for it and no other — and `unblock: <reason>` is what the runner
says when a run makes no progress (*Blocked: the bosun protocol*, below). {told_argument(SCRIPT)}

## The watch seat

After `start` — or where `start` said a runner is already running — {watch_seat_body(layout)}
## Run the ladder, and answer at its stops

Run `commands/drive.md` from *Enter at the first incomplete stage* to its end, exactly as written — the entry
stage from artifacts, the branch check, *Who runs each stage*, the benchmark bracket, the ready-set rules and
the concurrent fan-out. Wherever that command would stop for a person, this table says what to do instead;
where the table is silent, the ladder's own rule stands.

{stop_table(event, target, adoption)}

## Deciding: the skipper protocol

A product question is decided, never deferred, and every decision is written twice — into the artifact the
stage owns, and as the next entry of `{DECISIONS}`, which is the only place a person can read every decision
this run took. Read the standing entries before any decision, so a hundred answers stay consistent with each
other: for a slice's question, those `{SCOPE_VERB}` prints; for a feature-level one, every standing entry.
Under `decide: recommended-first`, decide here when the stage itself recommends an answer (the
release-constraint stage says *recommend the answer with its reason rather than asking an open question*),
when a standing entry already covers the question, or when the specification or the constitution answers it
outright. Anything else is an **open question**: delegate it to one fresh `{SKIPPER}` delegate with the
question, the stage, the options and the recommendation in its brief — the spec, the constitution, the owner
brief and the log are the standing part of its own brief — and **the number its entry will carry**. `D<n>` is
allocated here, before dispatch: the next after the last entry in `{DECISIONS}`, one per delegate in dispatch
order where several go out at once. The delegate returns the whole entry under that number and writes
nothing; this session appends it, in number order, and writes the decision into the artifact the stage owns.
Under `decide: skipper-always`, every question goes to the delegate. Several open questions in one turn are
several concurrent delegates, each with its own number; a slice delegate that handed one back does not wait
on the others. Every other identifier a decision adds to a shared artifact — a requirement, a criterion, an
example, a state — is allocated the same way: by this session, after the delegates return, in dispatch order.
A delegate cannot see what its siblings are adding, so it numbers nothing they share; two entries that came
back as the same `D3`, with requirement ranges that overlapped, were exactly the reconciliation by hand this
protocol exists to end.

The entry's shape, which `{layout.make} check-decisions` holds:

```markdown
{DECISION_ENTRY}
```

A decision that would break a constitution MUST is not available; the skipper says so and the question parks.
A fact nobody here has — a credential, a third party's behaviour, an approval — is `unavailable`, and the
skipper's brief says which those are: it is never decided, whatever `decide` says. A person overrides a
decision by editing its `Status` and writing the answer they want into the artifact; the next iteration
re-derives the entry stage from that artifact, the way demo feedback re-enters the ladder.

{ADR_RULE.replace('{REPORT}', REPORT)}

{hand_section(layout.make)}
## When the ready set is empty: the completion audit

An exhausted split is where `/drive` stops and where this command does its last stage. Delegate `/gaps` over
the whole of `specs/<feature>/spec.md` against what shipped — one `drive-gaps` delegate per feature area,
concurrently, as the post-implementation pass is per seam — and put every finding to the skipper protocol:
a criterion nothing built becomes a slice, appended to the split with `/story-splitting`, and the ladder is
re-entered for it; a finding the owner rules out of scope is a decision entry saying so. Write
`{REPORT}`: what the specification asked, what shipped, every out-of-scope decision, and every entry a person
has not yet reviewed. Only an audit with nothing left to build ends with `cruise: done`.

## The iteration contract

Spend this context on one unit of work, and then end the iteration rather than starting the next unit in a
context that has already carried one. **Before the split exists**, the unit is the upstream stages together —
{upstream} — through to the split's first ready set: each reads the one before it and none is a slice, so the
iteration does not end inside them; it ends when the split is written, or at a park. **From the split on**,
the unit is one slice through Phase 4 and its done marker, or one concurrent fan-out through its merges in
split order. `commands/drive.md` says *do not wait to be invoked again*; here the
outer loop is what re-invokes, with a fresh context, which is the rule every delegate already lives by.
Between stages, look for `{STOP_FILE}`: present, finish the stage's own writes, commit what is green, and end
on `{LAST_LINES[3]}`. {boundary_asks(SCRIPT)}
At every stage boundary and every delegation, rewrite the checkpoint (*Checkpoint*, below).
Where nothing can move — every ready slice blocked and the bosun could not move one, or a blocker is on the
catastrophic list — end with `parked` and the exact thing a person must provide or decide; the loop waits,
it does not exit. The last line of every iteration is one
of these, and the outer loop reads nothing else:

- `{LAST_LINES[0]}`
- `{LAST_LINES[1]}`
- `{LAST_LINES[2]}`
- `{LAST_LINES[3]}`

**An iteration ends only on one of those four lines.** Any other message that ends a turn is a stop, whatever
it says it is about to do: in Claude Code a message with no tool call *is* the end of the turn, so "continuing
into the plan now" is a stop that called itself progress. And an iteration is only ever a session the runner
started: where `python3 {SCRIPT} loop` said nobody is reading, this command started the runner and watched it
(*{UNREAD}*). Neither rule is left to this text. The runner reads the last line and re-invokes, on every
harness, and a session that ended without one is no progress to it. Where a harness lets a hook refuse the
end of a turn, the project's hook file runs `python3 {SCRIPT} stopping` there — `.claude/settings.json` runs
it as Claude Code's `Stop` hook, `.cursor/hooks.json` as Cursor's `stop`, `.gemini/settings.json` as Gemini
CLI's `AfterAgent`; `scripts/agents/registry.json`, `hooks`, says what each harness has — and while a runner
started the session, `{CHECKPOINT}` says an iteration is in flight and `{STOP_FILE}` is absent, it refuses a
turn that ends on anything but a last line and hands back the checkpoint's `Next:` line as the reason. It
lets go after three holds against a checkpoint nothing rewrote, so a session that cannot move is not held
forever; rewriting the checkpoint at every stage boundary is what keeps it moving.

## Checkpoint: what survives a compacted context

A harness can summarise this context at any point — Claude Code compacts, Gemini CLI compresses — and what a
summary loses is the state nothing on disk carries: which delegates are out and with what manifest, a
question half-answered, which slice's demo comes next. So keep `{CHECKPOINT}` current: rewrite it at every
stage boundary and every delegation, in this shape:

```markdown
{CHECKPOINT_ENTRY}
```

At the start of every stage, and whenever this context looks summarised — the iteration number is not in
memory, or a summary opens the context — read the checkpoint before acting; `python3 {SCRIPT} resume` prints
it with the rules beside it, and prints nothing where no iteration is in flight. Where the harness can run a
command after compaction, the project's settings do that for you: `.claude/settings.json` runs `resume` on
Claude Code's `SessionStart` with the `compact` matcher and stamps the checkpoint on `PreCompact`, and
`scripts/agents/registry.json`, `compaction`, says what each harness can. A checkpoint left by an earlier
iteration is a lead, never a result: its delegates ended with that session, so verify what they left in the
tree before continuing. The runner deletes the checkpoint when an iteration ends `done` or `stopped`, and so
does the stop hook; one that ends `continue` or `parked` leaves it for the next.

{unblock_section(SCRIPT)}
## What holds throughout

- **Parallelism is inherited and widened.** Everything *Running ready slices concurrently* allows runs the
  same way here. What no longer serialises the fan-out are the two stops that were a person's: a delegate's
  product question is answered while its siblings keep running, and a slice's demo runs in the hand while
  the next slice's delegate is still converging. Phase 4 stays one slice at a time on `main`. The worktrees
  beside the checkout are writable on Claude Code because the runner starts every iteration with `--add-dir`
  for the directory the checkout sits in (`scripts/agents/registry.json`, `headless.worktreeFlags`); on a
  harness whose row has no such flag, make the worktree inside the tree where the harness offers one, or run
  the ready slices one at a time here and say so, as the ladder does where the harness cannot delegate.
- **Flags stay off.** Under `release: flagged` nothing this run merges is visible to a real actor until a
  person flips a key. Turning a flag on is never a decision the log can contain.
- **The constitution's MUSTs are the floor.** No decision waives one; a question whose every option breaks
  one goes to the bosun for the reading that keeps them all, and parks only if there is none.
- **The hand edits no code.** A defect it finds is a task; a fix there would make the verdict evidence for
  itself.
- **Stuck is detected.** `stuck_after` iterations with the same artifact fingerprint give the bosun one
  iteration to move it, then park the loop; the same open question raised twice in one iteration goes the
  same way. A run that loops is not a run.
- **The record says who drove.** `driver=cruise` on every benchmark entry, `skipper`, `hand` and `bosun` as stages
  of their own, so a decision's cost and a demo's cost are numbers `{layout.make} benchmark` can read.
- **Settings change only through `/cruise-settings`**, never inside an iteration, and `{CONFIG}` is
  committed: a run's rules are a diff.

# Cruise settings

`{CONFIG}` holds how `/cruise` runs `commands/drive.md` with nobody at the wheel. `commands/cruise.md` says what
each value does at the stops it governs. This command is how the settings are read and how they change:
checked, at any time, and never by quietly running an iteration under different rules.

{settings_table()}

## No argument — show the settings

```sh
python3 {SCRIPT}
```

Report every line as printed — the value and what it controls — and whether a run is enabled at all.

## Arguments — change them

```sh
python3 {SCRIPT} --set $ARGUMENTS
```

Each argument is `key=value` from the table, and several may be given at once. The script refuses a key it
does not know, a value outside the ones listed, and a number that is not one, and writes nothing then. Report
a refusal in its words; do not work around it by editing the file. Then commit `{CONFIG}` on its own, with a
message naming the change: it takes effect at the next iteration, and nothing already running is interrupted.
`{layout.make} check-agents` holds the file's shape whether it was edited by hand or through this command.

## When the request is in words

"Turn it on" is `enabled=true`; "stop after tonight" is `max_hours=<n>`; "ask me before every release" is
`release=park`; "let the skipper decide everything" is `decide=skipper-always`; "drive on opus" is `model=opus`
(an identifier the harness's own model flag takes; `null` is its default); "back to the defaults" is
every key at the value the table shows. Stopping a run that is going is not a setting: it is `python3 {SCRIPT}
stop` — `touch {STOP_FILE}`, which ends the run after the iteration in flight; `--now` ends that iteration too
— and `commands/cruise.md` says how the run ends cleanly from either.
