Dependencies point inward: delivery adapters call application use cases; application code calls ports; domain code stays free of delivery and persistence concerns. Tests at the boundary protect observable behaviour.

## Services

`apps/` holds one directory per service — {listed} — each an independent deployable in its own language
and framework that starts with a health capability only. Every service owes the same things:

- the eight Make targets (`install`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `integration`, `adversarial`, `audit`,
  `mutation`): the root Makefile runs each recipe for every service, so there is one gate rather than one
  per service, and `make verify` is the same command however many there are;
- two probes on its own port, both paths in `infra/service/project.auto.tfvars.json`: liveness, which says
  only that the process is up, and readiness, which asks the event-store port a trivial question — so a
  service whose store is unreachable stops being sent traffic, and it is what Compose, the load balancer and
  `make smoke` wait on;
- the hexagonal layout — domain and application code free of adapters — which `make check-imports` enforces
  inside every directory under `apps/` and `packages/` (but not `.venv`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git`
  or the `target` at the root of a Java deployable `project.json` records, beside its `pom.xml`, which it never
  enters; a deployable recorded at one of those names is read), along with the seam between bounded
  contexts inside a service that holds more than one (*Bounded contexts*, below);
- schema change by expand then contract, in separate deployments, which `make check-migrations` holds every
  migration file in your own code to (the same five directories are not read): a drop, rename, type change or
  new NOT NULL column names the earlier additive migration it completes, and may not land in the same change
  as it;
- one slice's reach, which `make check-slice-scope` holds every `slice/<id>` branch to — its own record and
  model block, its service and context, the events module additively, new timestamped migrations only.

Which services exist is recorded once, in `project.json`'s `deployables`. The Makefile, `docker-compose.yml`,
the CI workflow, `scripts/check-imports.py` and `scripts/backing-services.py` read that list and none keeps a
copy, so adding a service is a change to the list and a regeneration of what reads it. That is what the
factory's `add-service` command does — `path/to/slipwai/slipwai add-service <name>`, run from
this directory — and it is the way to add one: it scaffolds `apps/<name>` with the walking skeleton, adapters
and contract tests a service of its language starts with, on the next free port. Without `--language` the
new service takes the first service's language and answers; with it, another language and that language's
own answers, so a project may hold a TypeScript service beside a Python one — and the skills' examples
then come in both languages, each block labelled with the services it is for. Every service's language,
framework and answers are in `project.json`. Replace each service's health example with its first product
slice instead of growing a framework around it.

## Shared code

`packages/` is for code shared between deployables, and a shared package is written in one language, so it
is shared among the deployables of that language. {shared}

The hexagonal rule applies inside it — a shared package that reaches for a framework or a driver is an adapter
every service now depends on — and `make check-imports` reads `packages/` the same way it reads `apps/`. Share
a contract when two services have a real consumer for it, not before; a contract crossing languages is an API
between services, not a package.

## Bounded contexts

Every service records what it owns and the bounded contexts it holds — `purpose` and `contexts` on its
`project.json` entry, given to `generate` or `add-service` as `--purpose` and `--context` (once per context),
and recorded afterwards with the factory's `slipwai describe-service <name> --purpose "..." --context <name>`,
which rewrites this page and every other file that prints them:

{contexts}

A context is a hypothesis about where one model and one vocabulary stop and another begins, and it gets
renamed, split and merged as the model deepens — which is why it is recorded as a field rather than as a
level of the tree, whose paths are baked into module names, Compose and CI. There are three places a
context can live, each costing more than the one before:

1. **A name on a service.** The service is one context, or has been given one. Free: it says what the
   service is for and nothing else.
2. **A directory inside a service** — a `<context>/` directory for each context the service holds (at
   `src/<context>/`, or inside each layer as `domain/<context>/`; the gate keys on the directory bearing
   the context's name, wherever it sits), each with its own glossary and one `public` module (`api` in
   Java) that is the whole of what the other contexts may import. This is the modular monolith a product
   starts as, and the default here: one deployable, several models. Once a service lists more than one
   context, `make check-imports` refuses an import from one context into another that does not go through
   that module{model_gate}. Which contexts a service holds is found, not declared up front — in the event
   model's lanes where this project keeps one, in the specification's vocabulary otherwise; `/drive` says
   where that decision is taken and recorded.
3. **A service of its own** — `apps/<name>`, through the factory's `add-service`. It costs a network
   boundary, a database of its own, its own image, pipeline and on-call.

Which rung a context sits on is two decisions, not one. *Whether it is a context* is a question about
language and ownership — the same word meaning two things, rules that change for different reasons,
different people deciding; `skills/domain-driven-design/resources/bounded-contexts.md` lists the signals.
*Whether it is a service* is a question about deployment: it has to release on its own cadence, scale or
run on its own terms, own its data in a store of its own, belong to another team, or be written in another
language. A context that talks to its neighbour synchronously and often, or shares a transaction with it,
is a context and not a service — keep it on the second rung. Find the boundary there, prove it with the
import gate and with events crossing it, and make it a service the day a deployment reason turns up;
because the seam was already enforced, that is a move rather than a rewrite.

Before placing a slice, read the purposes. With more than one service, the slice names the one that owns
it — the `service` field of its entry in `docs/event-model/model.yaml` where this project keeps an event
model, the plan's *Structure Decision* otherwise — and where that service holds more than one context, the
`context` as well. A slice that no recorded purpose covers is a product decision to ask, not a default to
take. A service with no purpose recorded is the first question to ask, before anything is placed in or
around it.

## Delegated agents

Each stage `/drive` sends to a fresh context is a named type in `agents/` (and a whole slice is `drive-slice`) carrying that stage's standing brief,
its model and its write scope, projected into the installed harness so it holds what it can. Delegate to the
type: a brief adds only its task-specific contract and file manifest, and restates neither the scope nor `docs/delegated-agent-safety.md` — a brief that restates a rule is one that can fall behind it.

## Per-slice continuation contract

The loop starts when any per-slice command is invoked: `/drive`, `/example-map`, or the installed Spec Kit
plan, tasks, and implement commands. Naming one stage requests that stage and what follows it. A
stage's own done condition is stage completion, not permission to end the delivery loop, and an optional
extension hook is not a gate.

Continue until the actor-visible path is ready for a demo, a product decision or unavailable external input
blocks progress, or the ordered split is exhausted. Before the demo, run the installed Spec Kit converge
command until it reports converged or reaches its bound, and `/gaps` over the slice diff. At the demo, pause for feedback. On
acceptance, harden and finish the slice — `/adversary` when the slice changed attack surface or closed the
split, then `/mutation` and `make verify` — then continue to the ready slices (not done, every `depends_on` done): every unclaimed one whose contract is settled runs concurrently, one delegate per slice on a `slice/<id>` branch, merged in split order (`commands/drive.md`, *Running ready slices concurrently*); where the harness cannot delegate, the earliest in split order, naming the rest.

Under `/cruise` the same contract holds with nobody at the wheel: the two stops that were a person's — a
product decision and the demo — are answered by `drive-skipper` and `drive-hand`, every answer is written where
a person's would have been and again in `specs/<feature>/decisions.md`, and an iteration ends with one line
(`cruise: continue | done | parked: <why> | stopped: human`) that the outer loop reads before it invokes the
next. `commands/cruise.md` is exact; it runs `commands/drive.md` and adds nothing to what a stage produces.

`commands/drive.md` is the resumable entry point at any point in the workflow. It derives the current stage
from artifacts and never re-runs a completed stage merely to make sure. Invoked before the upstream stages
exist — no ratified constitution, no specification, no modelled events, no split — it steps back to the
earliest stage still owing an artifact instead of improvising one. If it conflicts with this file, this
file wins.
