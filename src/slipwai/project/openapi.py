"""The published API document as a committed file, and the gate that keeps it honest.

A service that declares its routes' schemas already knows its own contract; what it did not have was a
copy of it anybody outside the process could read. `make openapi` writes one — from the app, with nothing
listening — and `make check-openapi` fails when the committed copy no longer matches the routes.

Three things want the file rather than the endpoint. `packages/api-client` is generated from it, so the
browser app's types come from the service's own contract and not from a hand-kept duplicate. A consumer
reads it without reading the service's language. And a reviewer sees a contract change in the diff, which
is the only place a breaking change is cheap to notice.

Not every transport has one to export. Go's document is hand-written — there is no generator on that
backend and buying one would cost the dependency it exists without — and `openapi_test.go` in the adapter's
own package is what holds it to the routes the mux serves, so it needs no recipe here. Quarkus and Spring
publish theirs from their own extensions. `export_command` answers for only the transports the factory can
write the file for, so a transport absent from it gets no recipe rather than a broken one.
