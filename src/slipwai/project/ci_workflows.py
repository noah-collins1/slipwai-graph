# What every `npm ci` in this workflow does about the registry, for a project that has one.
#
# `audit: false` is the one that matters. npm ends an install with a single POST to the registry's bulk
# advisories endpoint, and since 2026-09-04 that endpoint has answered in minutes rather than milliseconds —
# against about a tenth of a second for an ordinary packument GET, so the slowness is the registry's and not
# any one network's. npm does not fail on it: it waits out `fetch-timeout`, prints a summary with no audit in
# it, and carries on. That is what makes the stall so easy to misread — the install still passes, and the
# only tell is that a good run says `added N packages, and audited N+2 packages` where a stalled one says
# only `added N packages`. With npm's default five-minute timeout it costs five minutes per install, silently.
#
# Not asking costs this gate no strictness, because `make verify` never reads the audit; a project that wants
# advisories should run `npm audit` as a step of its own, where a slow answer is visible and its own failure.
# The rest cap what any one slow answer can cost. `prefer-offline` is safe under `npm ci` specifically: the
# lockfile already names every version and its integrity hash, so there is nothing fresher to ask for.

# How a job with `container:` gets the code, which is not `actions/checkout`.
#
# `actions/checkout` is a JavaScript action, and a job with `container:` runs a JS action *inside* that
# image rather than on the runner host. GitHub mounts its own Node into the container, so an action runs
# there whatever the image holds; Gitea's act_runner does not, and execs a bare `node` in an image that has
# none. Every `ci_image` but the TypeScript one is then a job that dies in its very first step with
# `exec: "node": executable file not found in $PATH` and exit 127 — before a line of the suite runs, with
# every later step reported `skipped`, and nothing whatever wrong with the code it was gating.
#
# Checked in the images rather than assumed: `golang:1.26-bookworm`, `python:3.13-bookworm` and
# `maven:3.9.16-eclipse-temurin-25-noble` each ship git and no node; `node:24-bookworm` ships both. So the
# job clones itself with git, and the containerised job is left with no `uses:` at all — the whole class
# leaves generated CI rather than one instance of it being worked around. A backend added later inherits
# that: `git` is one more thing its `ci_image` owes, and `node` stops being one.
#
# It also retires the one real argument for `needs: verify` here. That argument was a shared, unlocked act
# action cache (`/root/.cache/act/<hash>`, one directory per action) which two jobs starting the same
# instant could race, the loser dying in `Post actions/checkout@v6` with `Cannot find module .../dist/index.js`
# after all its real steps had passed. A job that downloads no action cannot lose that race.
#
# `--depth 1` of `$GITHUB_SHA` rather than of a branch: `$GITHUB_REF` moves when something merges while
# this run sits in a queue, and a suite that quietly tested a commit other than the one the run reports is
# worse than one that failed to start. Both forges serve a shallow fetch of a bare object id — Gitea's was
# checked against a real instance rather than assumed, since git refuses one by default and it is the whole
# reason this works.
#
# The credential is passed with `-c`, for the one fetch, rather than `git config`-ed into `.git/config`
# where every later step in the job could read it back out. `tr -d` because `base64` wraps at 76 columns
# and a token long enough to wrap would otherwise be sent with a newline in the middle of the header.

    """The job that runs one language family's integration suites against real infrastructure.

    `container:` is what makes this job correct on more than one kind of runner, and it is worth knowing
    why. Without it, a GitHub-hosted runner puts the job on the bare VM, where a service container's
    published port lands on `localhost` — so `localhost:5433` works there and nowhere else. A third-party
    runner (Gitea's act-runner, for one) always containerises the job, and inside that container `localhost`
    is the job's own loopback, never the sibling service. Only the service's *label* resolves, through the
    Docker network GitHub Actions creates once the job itself has a container. So the job takes a
    container, and the stanza in `CI_SERVICES` addresses the service by that label and drops the port
    mapping. That is correct on both, rather than correct on whichever runner was tried first.

    Taking that container is also why this job checks itself out with `git` rather than
    `actions/checkout` — a JS action runs *inside* the image, and most `ci_image`s have no Node to run it
    with. `CONTAINER_CHECKOUT` says the rest.

    One job per family with a suite to run, because a job has one container image and an image carries one
    toolchain: `integration` while there is one such family, `integration-<family>` once there are several.
    The image tracks the toolchain the verify job installs; move the two together.

    This job deliberately carries no `needs:`, and the emitted YAML says why at the point where somebody
    will want to add one. The short version: `needs: verify` was tried in a real generated project and left
    the dependent job permanently blocked on `push` runs against `main`, while `pull_request` unblocked
    correctly — so the pull request introducing it was green and the branch it protected silently stopped
