"""The `Makefile`: every local and CI entry point a generated project has.

`make verify` is the gate, and it is the same command locally and in CI. The targets a selection adds —
migrations, integration tests, the containers, the ways to run it — are marked regions, so a later
`./init` can cut them back out. Every recipe is built per service and merged, so a project with several
services — in one language or several — has one gate rather than one per service.
