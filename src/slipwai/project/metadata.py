"""`project.json`: the manifest — every answer this project was given, written once for everything that reads it.

Split from `readme.py`, which had reached its budget, and kept apart from `manifest.py`: that module reads a
written manifest back for `add-service` and `replay`, and this one writes it, so the shape is spelled in
two places on purpose — a factory that means something else by these fields is refused by the reader, not
silently accepted by the writer.

    """`project.json`: the answers this project was generated from, for a tool rather than a reader.

    `deployables` is the list of applications everything else reads — the Makefile, Compose, CI, the import
    gate and the pruner are generated from it or read it, and `add-service` appends to it. Each service
    carries its own language, framework and selection; there is no project-wide backend, because a project
    may have several. `schema` says which shape those readers expect; see `services.py`.

    `generator` is provenance, not configuration — nothing generated reads it: `generatedWith` created this
    repository and never changes, `updatedWith` is the newest to have written a file here (`add-service`
    moves it forward), and against the factory's `CHANGELOG.md` the pair says what it has yet to hear.
    `speckitSource` is the Spec Kit `./init` installs — a pinned release, so a rerun that restores the
    gitignored projections reinstalls the same version; `slipwai migrate` moves it as a visible diff.

    `adoption` is how the repository came to have this material: None for a generated one; for one the method
    was installed around, `"origin": "adopted"` after the generator and its facts after the layout, with its
    applications recorded `"generated": false`, claiming no capability and event-sourced in nobody's eyes.
    `parallel_safe` is the project's own word on whether its tests may run across cores, written as
    `"parallelSafe"` where a boolean is given and not at all for None — which is what `adopt` and a replay of
    a project made before the key pass, so a missing mark stays serial and is never added by a tool.
    `layout` is where things live: `applications` and `packages` as constants (`scripts/deploy.py` reads the
    second), and
    `delivery`, where the factory's own material sits — `.` here, and a directory such as `delivery` where
    the method was installed beside an existing codebase (`layout.py`)."""
