"""What an existing repository is made of, read off its tree: what `slipwai adopt` proposes and the person confirms.

Brownfield adoption (experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word) starts with a survey rather than a
questionnaire, because most of what the questionnaire would ask is already written in the tree: which
directories build, in what language, with which tools, pinned to which runtime; whether CI, containers and
infrastructure code are here; whether a database schema is versioned here, and with what. Every fact found
carries its evidence — the file that said so — so the person confirming can judge it rather than take it,
and everything here is a proposal: `provenance` in `project.json` records `detected` for what the tree
said, `confirmed` for what the person accepted and `overridden` for what they changed.

Bounded on purpose. The walk stops a few levels down and skips dependency and build output, a directory that
builds is not searched for builds inside it when its manifest says it owns them (npm workspaces, Maven
modules, a Gradle settings file, a .NET solution), and a signal this cannot read is reported as absent, not
guessed. `ecosystems.py` is the table of what can be recognised.
