"""What `adopt` says about the coding agent, and the `./init` run `adopt` and `generate` can each end with.

Brownfield adoption (#74; experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word). `harness.py` establishes which
harness the material is for and `init_script.py` generates the script; this is the edge between them — the
report's line about what was established and how, running the script once the adoption is committed, and
bringing the record up to what `./init` settled where `adopt` itself could not tell.

`generate` ends with the same run (`bootstrap`), so a new project is not a second command away from having
Spec Kit and its agent's skills. `./init` is a `/bin/sh` script, and a native Windows shell cannot run one:
there it goes through Git for Windows' `sh` when that is installed, and otherwise the run is not attempted
and the person is told which of WSL or Git Bash to reach for — never a failure half-way through.

What that setup needs is put on the machine rather than asked for: the coding agent is asked here, with no
answer preselected, instead of leaving Spec Kit's own list (which highlights Copilot) to ask it; and every
tool the choices imply — uv and Python for `./init`, each language's toolchain, the cloud's CLIs — is
installed through `host.ensure`, `sudo` included. On by default wherever somebody answered at a terminal;
`--install` asks for it from a script, `--no-install` turns it off, and `SLIPWAI_NO_INSTALL=1` carries that
into `./init` and every extension it runs.
