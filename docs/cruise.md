# Cruise: `/drive` with nobody at the wheel

`/drive` takes one slice from wherever it stands to a demo, and stops when it needs a person: for a product
decision, for an input nobody has given it, when the split has no ready slice left, and at every demo.
`/cruise` runs the same ladder, and answers the first and last of those stops itself: it decides as the
product owner, and it runs each demo as the actor. It keeps going, iteration after iteration, until the
specification is satisfied, and it stops only for a human.

Nothing about what a stage produces changes. What changes is who answers.

## What it guarantees

1. **It stops only for a human.** A stop file, Ctrl-C, or a person typing into the session ends a run. A
   finished slice, a demo, a product question, a stale checkout or a full context does not.
2. **It writes every answer down twice.** Each answer goes where `/drive` would have written a person's
   answer, and again into one log per feature. A person can read every decision the machine took in one
   place, and can overturn any of them. A decision that would cost a migration to reverse — an event's
   schema, stream identity, tenancy, the store, personal data, identity, a dependency, a contract — is also
   an ADR at `Proposed`, where the next slice looks for the reason; the run never accepts its own.
3. **It never invents an input, and it does not stop for one either.** A product *decision* is the owner's
   to make, and the machine makes it. A *fact* it does not have, such as a credential or a third party's
   behaviour, is never invented: the slice is marked blocked, the run takes the next ready slice, and a
   strong delegate, the bosun, works around the block. It puts a fake behind the port, recorded as a fake,
   or takes the narrower reading that keeps every rule, and writes down what it did. The run parks only for
   something catastrophic, or when the bosun could not move it.
4. **Done means the specification is satisfied.** When the split runs out, the last stage audits the
   specification against what shipped. Each finding becomes a new slice, or a recorded decision that it is
   out of scope. Only an audit with nothing left ends the run.
5. **The board is honest.** A slice the machine accepted says so. A person can see at a glance which demos
   a person has seen.
6. **An iteration ends only on one of its four last lines.** A message that says what it is about to do
   next is a stop, whatever it says, and where the harness has a hook that can refuse it, the project's hook
   file does. An iteration is only ever a session the runner started: typed in a session, `/cruise` starts
   the runner and ends, on every harness, so nothing depends on what a session does with its last line.

## Three roles and two loops

```text
outer loop — scripts/agents/cruise.py run: make cruise from a terminal, or what a typed /cruise starts (detached)
  a fresh harness session per iteration, through any CLI harness on PATH · the stop file · a stuck detector
  · parks when blocked · a log, which is the feed: one line per thing each iteration did
  │
  ├─ the watch seat — scripts/agents/cruise.py watch: the session that typed /cruise reads the feed as it is
  │  written and returns at each boundary; a person there is answered, and the run does not depend on it
  │
  └─ one iteration — /cruise
       driver: runs commands/drive.md as written, stage by stage, delegating as it does
         ├─ a product question ──▶ skipper: the host, or drive-skipper when the question is open
         │                          answer → the artifact, and specs/<feature>/decisions.md
         └─ the demo stop ────────▶ hand: drive-hand, with a browser where the slice has a screen
                                    verdict → demo-log.md, the benchmark outcome, back into the ladder
       ends with one line: cruise: continue | done | parked: <why> | stopped: human
       (held to that, where the harness has a stop hook: python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py stopping)
```

**The driver** is the session that runs `/cruise`. It runs `commands/drive.md` itself, not a copy of it, so
every rule of the ladder holds: fresh-context delegation, claims, the shared-surface rule, merges in split
order, the benchmark bracket. `/cruise` adds only the stop table, the two protocols below, the completion
audit and the iteration contract.

**The skipper** answers product questions. The driver answers on the host when the stage itself recommends
an answer, when a standing decision already covers the question, or when the specification or the
constitution answers it. Any other question is open. An open question goes to a fresh `drive-skipper`
delegate, with the number its entry will carry: the driver allocates `D<n>` before dispatch, one per
delegate in dispatch order, so several deciding at once never come back with the same one. That delegate
reads the specification, the constitution, the owner brief and the decision log, and then decides. It
states its confidence and the one condition that would reverse the decision. It does not defer, and it
writes nothing: it returns the whole entry, the driver appends it in number order and writes the decision
into the artifact. Every other identifier a decision adds — a requirement, a criterion, an example — is the
driver's to number after the delegates return, for the same reason. `skipper` is a role of its own in `.specify/models.json`, so a project can run a bigger model on
deciding than on driving: `/model-delegation-settings claude.skipper=opus`. The driver's own model is the one
thing that table cannot choose, because `host` means "whatever the session runs", and under `/cruise` nobody
opened the session: `/cruise-settings model=opus` names it, and the runner passes it with the harness's own
flag on every iteration.

**The hand** runs the demo. A fresh `drive-hand` delegate takes exactly what the demo stop hands a person:
the board, the command or URL to run, the seed data, the expected result. It also takes the acceptance
script: the slice's `examples.md`, or its acceptance criteria in `spec.md`. It walks every example as the
actor would, starting at the rung `hand` names in `.specify/cruise.json` — `browser`, `http` or `cli` — and
never climbing above it. It gives its verdict in the three words the benchmark already knows: `accepted`,
`behaviour` or `implementation`. The driver then re-enters the ladder at the stage that owns the change,
exactly as `commands/drive.md` says demo feedback does, and stops what the demo started: the ladder leaves the
app running for a person's first action, and here that person was the hand.

**The inner loop** is one `/cruise` invocation. It spends its context on one unit of work. Before the split
exists, the unit is the upstream stages together: principles, the specification, the event model where there
is one, and the split, through to the first ready set. From the split on, it is one slice through its
hardening, or one concurrent fan-out through its merges. Then it ends with one machine-readable line.
**The outer loop** is a script. It runs the harness headless with a fresh context, reads that last line, and
runs again until the line says `done` or a human stops it. Both loops are needed. `/drive` derives every
stage from artifacts on disk, which is what lets a fresh session resume correctly, and no single context
lasts a whole product.

## What it does at each stop

The table below is the one a generated project carries in `commands/cruise.md`, for the event profile with a
production target. A `standard` project reads its criteria from `spec.md` instead of `examples.md`. A project
with no production target has no release rows. An adopted repository has three more rows; see
[The limits](#the-limits).

| # | Where `/drive` stops | What `/cruise` does there | Recorded in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The checkout is behind trunk, or the fetch failed | Fetch and fast-forward where the tree is clean. Rebase a `slice/<id>` branch that has local commits. A conflict parks. A fetch that could not run, because there is no remote or it cannot be reached, is said in the evidence line the way `/drive` says it, and the run goes on: without a remote the local branch is the claim. | `specs/cruise-log.jsonl` |
| 2 | The constitution is not ratified | With `constitution: ratify`, the skipper drafts it with `/speckit-constitution` from the spec and the owner brief, answers `/constitution-coverage`, and ratifies it with the line `ratified by cruise (skipper) — pending human review`. With `park`, the run stops here. | `constitution.md`, a decision entry |
| 3 | There is no product specification | Refuse to start. A specification is the one thing a person brings. | — |
| 4 | Which service or bounded context owns a slice | Decide against each service's recorded `purpose`. Where none covers it, record the purpose the spec implies with `slipwai describe-service <name> --purpose`, then decide. Contexts are recorded the same way, with `--context`. | the model or plan, `project.json`, a decision entry |
| 5 | Slice gaps: one question at a time | The gaps loop runs with the owner as the other party. Each gap is answered, by the host or the skipper, and written back as the criterion or state. | `examples.md`, a decision entry per question |
| 6 | The release constraint | Take the stage's own recommendation. With `release: flagged`, every slice continues or opens a flag seeded `off`, so every merge is dark and a person flips the keys. With `park`, the run stops at the push. | `plan.md`, the flag file, a decision entry |
| 7 | "A release they want now": no flag, or a flag already on, before the push | Never answered by the machine. Under `flagged` it does not arise. Where it does, park with the exact question. | a `parked` line in the log |
| 8 | A delegate hands back a product question in `plan.md` | Answer it, un-block the slice, and re-dispatch the delegate with the entry as a pointer, never as a conclusion. | `plan.md`, a decision entry |
| 9 | Converge appended tasks and the `/gaps` pass says stop | Already bounded by the ladder. Continue to the demo. | — |
| 10 | The demo stop | Delegate to `drive-hand` with what the stop hands a person, plus the acceptance script. Take its verdict as the actor's. Acceptance is marked `accepted-by: drive-hand`. | `demo-log.md`, the benchmark `outcome=`, the register |
| 11 | The ready set is empty | Not a stop. Run the completion audit. Only an audit with nothing left is `done`. | `specs/<feature>/cruise-report.md`, decision entries |
| 12 | An input nobody has: a credential, an external system, a person's approval | Never decided. Record it as blocked with what is needed. Take the next ready slice. Park only when nothing can move. Under `decide: provisional` the skipper takes a person's approval provisionally where the change is easy or guarded to reverse and none of `flag_default=yes`, `ci_workflow=yes` or `migrate_file=yes` holds, and never for a gate, a check or CI question (see [Provisional decisions](#provisional-decisions)): that is not a block, so no bosun and no ⛔. | a `parked` line in the log, ⛔ on the board |

**The completion audit** runs where `/drive` would say the split is exhausted. `/gaps` runs over the whole of
`spec.md` against what shipped, one `drive-gaps` delegate per feature area. Each finding goes to the skipper:
a criterion nothing built becomes a slice, appended to the split with `/story-splitting`; a finding the
owner rules out of scope becomes a decision entry that says so. The report lists what the specification
asked, what shipped, every out-of-scope decision, and every decision a person has not yet reviewed.

## Provisional decisions

`decide` has five values, and only a person moves it, one rung at a time: `recommended-first`, `skipper-always`,
`provisional-shadow`, `provisional-advisory`, `provisional`. Only the skipper takes an item from the owner brief's
*Always ask a person* provisionally, and only a person's approval: it scores the tier with `scripts/reversibility.py`,
then asks `python3 scripts/provisional.py status` what to write. Under `provisional-shadow` and `provisional-advisory`
nothing is taken: the item stays `unavailable`, the skipper's `status` is `unavailable`, and the entry only gains a
`Provisional (shadow):` or `Provisional (advisory):` line saying what `provisional` would have done; advisory also
names the recommendation, and `/cruise-tell accept` takes it: the skipper returns the verb's `cruise: parked: …` line
verbatim in `unresolved`, and a park on that item ends the run on it. Under all three provisional values every
always-ask item goes to the skipper, even where the stage recommends an answer, and the host names `decide` in its
brief. Under `provisional`, and only there, an easy or guarded item that holds none of `flag_default=yes`,
`ci_workflow=yes` or `migrate_file=yes` goes ahead, where its `Written to` names no CI workflow, no control and no file
a gate reads as its configuration, with `Status: provisional · ratify by <date>` — the entry's `When` date plus
seven days, UTC — and a `Revert:` line, and every commit made under it carries the trailer `Decision: D<n>`. A gate, a
check, CI, a credential, a third party's behaviour, a constitution MUST and a release are never provisional, and
`check-decisions` holds a ratified entry to the same refusals. At the start of an iteration
`python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py mode` records any change of `decide` as one entry in the log of the feature it works
in, judged against the last mode entry in any feature's log; a value more than one rung above it parks the run, so
let an iteration record each rung before setting the next. An iteration never sets `decide`: `guard` refuses an edit
to `.specify/cruise.json` in a runner's session (by any name for the file, a hard link included), `--set decide` and
`tell` are refused while `CRUISE_ITERATION` is set, and the runner parks on any raise of `decide` it sees — inside an
iteration, between two, while parked, or behind a settings file that was broken and then mended. Only a `told:`
message releases that park, so a person who changed it on purpose resumes with `/cruise-tell`; a raise through
`/cruise-settings` while the runner runs queues that confirmation itself and parks nothing, and a step back never
parks. A mode entry dated after now is not read, and the settings file naming a key twice is refused. `recommended-first`
and `skipper-always` are both the bottom rung, so either goes to `provisional-shadow` in one step. Until the ratify and
revert verbs ship, ratification is by hand, as below.
The completion audit runs `python3 scripts/provisional.py audit` over every feature's log: while a provisional entry
stands, the run ends `cruise: parked: ratify D<n> in specs/<feature>/decisions.md`. Ratify by editing `Status` to
`ratified <date>`; revert the commits carrying the trailer and write `reverted <date>`.

## Where it keeps its answers

`/drive` reads artifacts, not memory, and `/cruise` keeps that rule. Nothing a run needs to resume lives
only in a context window. Four things are added to a project.

| File | Holds | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|
| `specs/<feature>/decisions.md` | The decision log: one numbered entry per product answer, with the question, the options, the decision, the reason, who decided (the host, `drive-skipper` with its model, `drive-bosun`, or a human), the confidence, the condition that would reverse it, the artifacts it was written into, and its status. Append-only, numbered by the driver before a delegate decides. | the driver; the skipper returns its entry and the driver appends it; a person overrides an entry by editing its status |
| `docs/adr/NNNN-<title>.md` | One ADR, in Nygard's five sections, for each decision whose reversal would be a migration rather than a refactor — the `architecture-decisions` skill's test. Status `Proposed`; the decision entry's `Written to` names it. | the driver, from the skipper's draft or its own; a person accepts or supersedes it |
| `.specify/product-owner.md` | The owner brief: who the actor is, what the product is for, priorities, tie-breakers, taste, what is out of scope. The skipper reads it before every decision. Edit it to steer a run without stopping it. | a person |
| `specs/<feature>/slices/<id>/demo-log.md` and `demo/` | One section per demo: what was started and how, each example walked and what happened, the verdict, the feedback, and the screenshots and responses under `demo/`. | `drive-hand` |
| `specs/cruise-log.jsonl` and `specs/<feature>/cruise-report.md` | The outer loop's record, one line per iteration, and the completion audit's report. | the runner and the driver |

The benchmark record gains `driver=cruise` on every stage a run bracketed, and `skipper`, `hand` and `bosun` are
stages of their own, so `make benchmark` can say what a decision cost and what a demo cost.

## Start a run, watch it, stop it

A project ships with `/cruise` disabled. To start, in any harness's session:

```sh
/cruise-settings enabled=true     # commits .specify/cruise.json
/cruise                           # starts the runner, detached from this session, and watches it from here
/cruise use the PRD in docs/prd.md   # the same, with a kick-off the first iteration is given
/cruise-status                    # is a runner running, how the last iteration ended, the tail of the feed
/cruise-watch                     # sit back down at the watch seat, where the feed left off, starting nothing
/cruise-stop                      # end the run after the iteration in flight; `/cruise-stop now` ends it now
/cruise-tell take the payments feature next   # queued: the next iteration carries it; `--now` first ends the one in flight for it
```

or from a terminal, `make cruise`, which runs the same loop in the foreground. Either way the runner is the
one thing that continues a run: `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py run` starts one fresh headless session per
iteration, reads its last line, and runs again until the line says `done`. A parked run waits, and re-checks
every `poll_minutes` for a reason to resume: the stop file, or an artifact a person changed.

A `/cruise` typed into a session never runs the ladder itself. The command asks `python3
scripts/agents/cruise.py loop` who is reading its last line; where nobody is, it runs `python3
scripts/agents/cruise.py start` with whatever was typed after `/cruise`, repeats what that printed, and takes
the watch seat. `start` checks everything that can refuse before it detaches — the settings, the stop file, a
runner already running, no harness on the PATH it can run an iteration through — so the refusal is what you
read. The runner then writes to `.specify/cruise-run.log`, keeps its pid in `.specify/cruise.pid`, and
`make cruise-status` says whether it is running and what the log shows. This is the same on every harness,
because it needs nothing of the session beyond a shell.

**The kick-off.** What you type after `/cruise` — what the run is for, where the brief or the PRD is, which
feature — is the first iteration's argument and no later one's: every iteration after the first runs a bare
`/cruise` and derives its stage from disk, the rule the whole ladder lives by. So the first iteration writes
down whatever the kick-off says that must outlive it — a PRD it names becomes the specification through the
ladder's own stages, a preference goes into the owner brief, a scope it sets is a decision entry — before it
does anything else.

**The watch seat.** The session that typed `/cruise` stays with the run. `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py
watch` prints the feed from where the last watch left off — one line per command, file, and delegate out and
back, as the iteration does them — and returns at the iteration's end, a park, the run's end, once the feed
has gone quiet for twenty seconds, or after a minute and a half with nothing new, saying which. It returns on
quiet because a harness shows a command's output when the command returns: that is what puts the feed in
front of a person every half minute or so while an iteration works, rather than in one lump at its end. The command runs it again while the run
continues, and ends the turn when it says parked, ended or no runner. Watching is only ever reading: the
runner needs nothing from the session, so leaving the seat ends nothing, and `/cruise` typed again later
finds the runner running and sits back down where the feed left off. A person typing into that session is
talking to the agent, not stopping the run: it answers — the feed, the settings, the status, the decision log
— changes a setting through `/cruise-settings` where asked, and watches again. Where the person asks where the
run stands or what is next, `/where-are-we` and `/whats-next` answer from disk beside the run: each first
runs `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py where`, which prints the runner's iteration, the checkpoint's slice,
stage and next step, and a park's reason — and prints nothing where no runner is running, so outside a run
both commands answer exactly as they always did. Under a run their step for a person is never a command to
type: the runner is on it, and `/cruise-tell` is how to steer it. Every line `watch` printed
goes into the reply unchanged, because a harness folds a command's output to a few lines and the feed has to
reach the person, not the transcript. `/cruise-watch` is the seat on its own — a session that read a
`/cruise-status` and stopped watching sits back down with it, starting nothing — and `make cruise-watch` is
the same seat from a terminal; `/cruise-status` in any session is the runner's state and the feed's tail
without sitting down.

The feed is the harness's own event stream, rendered. The registry's `headless` row names the stream where a
harness has one — Claude Code's `--output-format stream-json --verbose`, Codex's `exec --json` — and the
runner keeps the raw stream in `.specify/cruise-stream.jsonl` beside the log it rendered into. A harness with
no stream is echoed as it comes. In Claude Code a refused permission is in the feed the moment it happens,
`denied Bash python3 …`, which is how a run that parks thirty seconds in is seen thirty seconds in.

Which harness the runner drives is `scripts/agents/registry.json`'s business, under `headless`: for each
harness, how it runs one prompt non-interactively and exits, read from its own documentation on the date the
row names — 27 of the 36 have a row; the nine that do not say why, editor-only or unreachable docs. The runner
takes the first installed harness with a row whose binary is on the PATH, and the log names which. A CLI that
is on the PATH but was never initialised here is not used: its commands, delegate types and hook files are not
projected, so `/cruise` is unknown to it and the ladder's delegates and holds are absent. The refusal names it
with the `./init --integration <key>` that adds it beside what is installed, which is how a `/cruise` typed
into Zed or Antigravity comes to run through a CLI harness. Only Claude Code's print mode is known to resolve
`/cruise` itself; every other harness is asked, in the same words, to read `commands/cruise.md` and follow it.
`CRUISE_HARNESS_COMMAND`, a shell template with `{prompt}`, overrides the choice.

What an iteration may do is the row's `permissions`. A headless session has nobody to ask, so it is refused
whatever its rules do not name, and no list names the compound commands an agent writes: Claude Code's row
therefore runs `--permission-mode acceptEdits` with `--allowedTools` naming every tool family the ladder
reaches for — `Bash`, the shell allowed wholesale, with the project's `.claude/settings.json` `deny` rules (a
plain force-push, `reset --hard`, `clean`) still refusing what they name; `Skill` and `Agent`, the project's
own commands and delegates; `WebFetch` and `WebSearch`, because a stage reading documentation has nobody to
ask; and `mcp__codegraph__*`, the code index's tools. Each of those was tried from a print session before it
was named, and the two web tools were the only refusals. The same session is refused an edit outside its
working directory, and the ladder's concurrent slices work in worktrees beside the checkout, so the row's
`worktreeFlags` pass `--add-dir` for the directory the checkout sits in. Codex's row runs
`--sandbox workspace-write`, because `codex exec` is read-only by default and an iteration run bare could edit
nothing. Each harness's `projectMcp` row names the project
file it reads an MCP server from — the file `./init --extension codegraph` commits with the index's server in
it, `.mcp.json` on Claude Code, `.codex/config.toml` on Codex, and so on — and the flags that make a headless
iteration honour it whenever the file exists: `--mcp-config` on Claude Code, whose print session in a checkout
nobody has trusted ignores the project's settings, the servers they approve and the allow rules they carry
(hooks still run); a one-run trust override on Codex, which skips every project `.codex/` layer in an
untrusted project. What the iteration needs travels on its command line. Before the first iteration, `start` says how the index will be
reached, or that it cannot be. Before every iteration the runner makes the index one it can query
(`scripts/agents/code_index.py health`): it opens the database and runs SQLite's integrity check, moves a
corrupt one to `.codegraph/corrupt/` and rebuilds it — the database is ignored by Git and derived from the
source, and CodeGraph's own `status` and `sync` call a malformed one up to date — and syncs one the tree has
moved past; the entry's `index` says which, and the feed says it before the iteration starts. That check narrows as the
gate does, on any branch outside CI: it hashes only what changed since the last whole comparison, and what a narrowed
comparison cannot see — a file whose bytes changed while its size, times and identity all read as before — it cannot
see either; deleting `.codegraph/gate-memory.json` makes its next comparison whole. The runner's check before an
iteration writes that record when it ends current, as a passing gate run does, and never in CI. Inside the
iteration, on Claude Code, a `PostToolUse` hook syncs the index each time a delegate returns (CodeGraph's watcher
is off wherever it decides it is sandboxed, so the index is not trusted to follow), and a `PreToolUse` hook
refuses a search of the source for a symbol from any session or delegate — told apart by the event's `agent_id`
— that has not asked the index yet, naming `scripts/codegraph callers <symbol>` instead; words, phrases and
searches confined to documents are never refused. After it, the entry's `index_use` and the feed count index
queries per agent, the host and each delegate in the order it was sent, and name the one that searched the
source for a symbol first, which `status` repeats for the last five iterations. A harness whose stream does not
mark a delegate's events is counted as the host alone; there the hooks do not exist either, and the count and
`make check-codegraph` are what is left. `--sandbox` on `run` or `start` swaps in the row's `sandboxPermissions`, which bypasses every
check, and is for a container with nothing to lose. Which tools a whole build needs is measured, not
guessed: every refusal is in the feed as it happens, and `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py denials` lists
them all afterwards from the raw stream, by tool and command, with the iterations each happened in — the
list to read before widening a row or a rule, and the proof that a deny rule fired when it should.

**Telling the run something.** A run under way is steered with `/cruise-tell <message>`, `make cruise-tell
MSG="…"`, or `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py tell …` from anywhere. The message is queued, never pushed into
the iteration in flight: it goes to `.specify/cruise-inbox.jsonl`, and the runner reads the inbox before it
starts each iteration and hands everything there over as `told: <message>` in that iteration's argument — the
route the kick-off takes, one `told:` per message in the order they were sent. The command reads it before the
first stage and acts on it first: a steer outranks what the artifacts alone would make the iteration do, a fact
the run lacked is the answer to a block, and a scope or a preference is written into the owner brief or a
decision entry so it outlives the iteration, the way the kick-off is. A message is not a setting; `/cruise-settings`
is still how a rule of the run changes. Between stages an iteration runs `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py told`,
which prints what was queued since it started and takes it, so a message can land mid-iteration without cutting
a stage; that read is the command's, and the runner's read before each iteration is the one nothing can skip. A
parked run resumes with a message within the second — the inbox and the stop file are checked every second, the
tree every `poll_minutes` — and a message waiting when a run is stuck goes in place of the bosun's `unblock:`
iteration, since a person's word is the likelier thing to move it, with the bosun's iteration kept for after.
`--now` as the message's first word interrupts instead: the runner ends the iteration in flight the way `stop
--now` does — its increment commits are on the slice branch, the stage's uncommitted work is what it costs, and
a benchmark entry it left open is cut off — and starts the next at once with the message; the log entry says
the iteration was interrupted, and an interrupted iteration is not counted by the stuck detector. Every message
an iteration was given, whichever read took it, is in that iteration's entry in `specs/cruise-log.jsonl` under
`told`, and `/cruise-status` lists what is queued and not yet taken. From the watch seat, typing something that is
for the run — an answer to the question it parked on, a steer — is queued the same way, and the seat repeats
what the script said: whether it waits for the iteration in flight, resumes a parked run, or ended the iteration.

To stop a run, do one of these. Each is safe in the middle of a slice, because the slice's commits are on
its branch and the next iteration re-derives its stage from the artifacts.

- Type `/cruise-stop` in any session, run `make cruise-stop`, or `touch .specify/cruise.stop`. The runner ends
  after the iteration in flight, and the command checks between stages, finishes the stage's own writes,
  commits what is green, and ends. `/cruise-stop now` or `make cruise-stop CRUISE_FLAGS=--now` ends the
  iteration in flight too. Either way, a benchmark entry the iteration left open is cut off by the runner, with
  the reason and no tokens, so `make check-benchmark` does not find it still running.
- Press Ctrl-C on a foreground runner. The harness session dies with it.

## The settings

`.specify/cruise.json` holds them. `/cruise-settings key=value` changes them, checked, and a change takes
effect at the next iteration. `make check-agents` holds the file's shape.

| Setting | Values | Default | Controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true`, `false` | `false` | whether `/cruise` runs at all |
| `decide` | `recommended-first`, `skipper-always`, `provisional-shadow`, `provisional-advisory`, `provisional` | `recommended-first` | who answers a product question: the host where the stage recommends an answer or a standing decision covers it, and `drive-skipper` otherwise; or `drive-skipper` for every question. Change it to `provisional-shadow` when always-ask questions are stalling slices and you want to see which ones would have been taken provisionally before letting any be; move on to `provisional-advisory`, then `provisional`, once the shadow lines read right. The first two take nothing and only show what `provisional` would have done; `provisional` takes an easy or guarded approval itself. `recommended-first` and `skipper-always` are both the bottom rung, so either moves to `provisional-shadow` in one step. Let an iteration record each rung before setting the next. |
| `release` | `flagged`, `park` | `flagged` | the release-constraint stage: every slice behind a flag seeded off, so every merge is dark; or park at the push and let a person decide |
| `constitution` | `ratify`, `park` | `ratify` | an unratified constitution: the skipper drafts and ratifies it, marked pending human review; or park |
| `hand` | `browser`, `http`, `cli` | `browser` | the top of the hand's ladder for a demo; each falls through to the next where it cannot run |
| `unblock` | `bosun`, `park` | `bosun` | what a block becomes: work for the bosun first, a park only at the catastrophic or when it fails; or a park at once |
| `stuck_after` | a whole number | `3` | iterations with no artifact change before the loop parks |
| `max_iterations` | a whole number or `null` | `null` | a budget on iterations; `null` is unbounded |
| `max_hours` | a whole number or `null` | `null` | a budget on wall time; `null` is unbounded |
| `poll_minutes` | a whole number | `10` | how often a parked loop looks for a reason to resume |
| `model` | a model identifier or `null` | `null` | the model the iteration itself runs on: the driver, and every stage `.specify/models.json` maps to `host`. `null` is the harness's default. The registry row's `modelFlag` carries it (`--model` on Claude Code, Codex and Gemini CLI); where a row has none, the runner says the default runs |

## What a person reviews afterwards

Read these, in this order.

1. `specs/<feature>/cruise-report.md`: what shipped, what was ruled out of scope, and every decision not yet
   reviewed.
2. `specs/<feature>/decisions.md`: every decision, with its reason. To overturn one, change its `Status` and
   write the answer you want into the artifact it names. The next iteration re-enters the ladder from that
   artifact.
3. `docs/adr/`: every ADR the run left at `Proposed`. Accept it, or write the superseding one; an agent never
   accepts its own architecture decision.
4. Each slice's `demo-log.md` and `demo/`: the evidence behind every `accepted-by: drive-hand`.
5. The constitution, if the run ratified it: the line `pending human review` is yours to remove.
6. The flags: nothing the run merged is visible to a real actor until you turn a key on.

## The browser

Where a slice has a screen, the hand drives it through a browser. It uses Vercel Labs'
[`agent-browser`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser) first. This is a command-line tool, so it
runs from the shell on every harness, and every snapshot and screenshot it takes is a file that goes under
`demo/`. The hand installs it on demand, the way the run skill installs Playwright:

```sh
npm install -g agent-browser && agent-browser install
```

It finds an installed Playwright or Chrome before it downloads one. `agent-browser snapshot` returns an
accessibility tree with references, and the hand clicks and fills by reference. `--allowed-domains` fences
it to the addresses the run skill names. Where the tool cannot be installed, the hand uses a browser tool the
harness exposes. Where there is none, it drives the API over HTTP and records that the screen was judged
from its API alone. `agent-browser` is never a dependency of the project.

## When the context is compacted

A harness can shorten a long context at any point. Claude Code calls this compaction; Gemini CLI calls it
compression. A summary loses the state that no file carries: which delegates are out and with what
manifest, a question that is half answered, which slice's demo comes next.

`/cruise` keeps that state in one small file, `specs/cruise-checkpoint.md`. It rewrites the file at every
stage boundary and at every delegation. At the start of every stage, and whenever its context looks
summarised, it reads the file before it acts. `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py resume` prints the
checkpoint with the rules beside it, and prints nothing when no iteration is in flight. The file is run
state, not a record: it is ignored by git, and the runner deletes it when an iteration ends with `done` or
`stopped`.

Where a harness can run a command after compaction, the project's settings replay the checkpoint for you.
On Claude Code, `.claude/settings.json` runs `resume` on the `SessionStart` hook with the `compact` matcher,
and stamps the checkpoint on `PreCompact`. Both commands print nothing unless an iteration is in flight, so a
plain `/drive` session never sees them. `scripts/agents/registry.json` records under `compaction` what each
harness can do, read from its documentation on a named date: Gemini CLI has a `PreCompress` event but nothing
that adds context afterwards, and the rest are `null` until someone checks. On those harnesses the checkpoint
still works; only the automatic replay is missing, and the command's rule to re-read the file covers it.

## How an iteration is held to its end

Prose in a command file is not a control. One session ended an iteration after the upstream stages, because
the contract named no unit before the split; the same session later ended a turn on a report that said
"continuing into the plan now", which in Claude Code is the end of the turn whatever the sentence says.
`make verify` was green both times, and the checkpoint correctly said an iteration was in flight, and nothing
read it. So the end of a turn is checked where the harness lets a hook refuse it.

The control is the runner. It marks every session it starts (`CRUISE_RUNNER`, `CRUISE_ITERATION`), reads
the last line, and treats an iteration that ended without one as no progress, which the stuck detector then
counts. A typed `/cruise` starts the runner rather than running an iteration, so there is no session whose
last line matters and nobody is reading.

The hook is the seatbelt inside a runner's iteration, where a harness has one. `python3
scripts/agents/cruise.py stopping` runs from the project's hook file: `.claude/settings.json` on Claude
Code's `Stop`, `.cursor/hooks.json` on Cursor's `stop`, `.gemini/settings.json` on Gemini CLI's `AfterAgent`.
In a session the runner started, while `specs/cruise-checkpoint.md` says an iteration is in flight and
`.specify/cruise.stop` is absent, it refuses a turn whose last message does not end on one of the four last
lines, spelled the way that harness reads a refusal — a block decision, or Cursor's follow-up message — with
the checkpoint's own `Next:` line as the reason. Every hold is stamped on the checkpoint, and the hook lets go
after three holds against a checkpoint nothing rewrote, so a session that cannot move is not held forever:
rewriting the checkpoint at every stage boundary, which the command already requires, is what keeps a turn
holdable. A turn that ends on `done` or `stopped` takes the checkpoint with it. Cursor's stop event carries no
text, so its `afterAgentResponse` hook keeps the last message for it (`cruise.py responded`); an event that
carries no message and no kept one is no evidence, and the hook does not hold on none. Outside a runner's
iteration the hook does nothing, so a plain `/drive` session, and a typed `/cruise`, never meet it.

`scripts/agents/registry.json` records under `hooks`, for every harness, whether it has a hook that fires
when a turn ends and can refuse the end, how, and the projection `scripts/agents/project.py` writes — merged
into a file a person may keep other keys in, and held to by `make check-agents`. Where the file's shape was
not read, or a harness's hook cannot continue the agent, the row says so and the runner's own reading of the
last line is what holds.

## When it is blocked

A block is work before it is a stop. When the run meets an input nobody has, a question whose every option
seems to break a constitution rule, a checkout that will not rebase, or an iteration that made no progress,
it marks the slice blocked, takes the next ready slice, and hands the block to a third delegate,
`drive-bosun`, on the skipper's model role. The bosun takes the least surprising way round, in this order:

1. **Stub the world.** The code is a hexagon, so a fake adapter goes behind the port the missing thing sits
   behind, chosen by configuration and seeded with what the examples need. The plan records it as a
   deliberate stub, so the progress board shows it under *Not working yet*. A stub is always recorded as a
   stub, never as a fact about the real system.
2. **Narrow the reading.** Where every option seems to break a rule, it takes the reading that keeps every
   rule and defers the rest behind the slice's flag. The amendment a person may want becomes an ADR at
   `Proposed`, never ratified by the machine. In an adopted repository a fact the tree cannot say stays
   `unrecorded` or `detected`: the bosun works on the survey's value as a stated assumption and never marks
   it `confirmed`.
3. **Repair the run.** Rebase and resolve, finish or revert what a dead delegate left, find why a gate
   loops and fix the cause in the tree the gate measures.

Every move is an entry in `decisions.md` with `Decided by: drive-bosun`, the condition under which a person
should undo it, and a task in the next slice to remove the stub when the real thing arrives. Nothing done to
get moving is done silently. When the outer loop sees no progress for `stuck_after` iterations, it gives the
bosun one iteration before it parks, and the log marks that iteration `attempt: unblock`.

**What always parks.** The bosun refuses, and the run parks, at anything on this list: destroying data or
history; releasing what a person has not asked for, such as turning a flag on or deploying to production;
spending money or exposing a secret; weakening security; discarding a person's commits to make a checkout
consistent; making a gate pass by changing the gate. It also parks when the bosun could not move the block.
`unblock: park` switches the bosun off and parks at once.

**A failing gate is never repaired in the gate.** A run once met `check-ux-gates` failing because two of the
kit's scripts crash where Chrome is not installed, and the bosun patched `scripts/check-ux-gates.py` to call
that skipped, committed it, and went on. That is a gate made to pass, and the rule is now held mechanically
rather than said louder. Nothing under `scripts/` — the `check-*` gates, the runner itself — the `Makefile`,
anything under `tools/`, CI, or a harness's hook settings is an iteration's to change. `make verify` red on the
slice's own tree is the slice's work; red for a reason the tree cannot fix — a browser the machine has not got,
a tool not installed, a kit script that crashes — parks the run with the gate's own words as the reason,
`cruise: parked: <gate>: <what it said>`, so a person reads what the gate said and not what an iteration made
of it. Two controls hold it. On Claude Code, `python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py guard` runs as the `PreToolUse`
hook of every editing tool (`Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`) and, in a session the runner
started, refuses an edit to any of those paths before it lands, with the reason as the tool's result — a
2.1.281 print session, probed 2026-09-24. And on every harness the runner takes the content of every file
under those paths before an iteration and compares it after: any file modified, deleted or added — except a
file installed under `tools/`, which is what `./init --extension` does — parks the run at once, naming the
files, whatever the iteration's last line said; the log entry carries them as `controls_changed`. A person
reverts the change, or keeps it on purpose and resumes with a message. The runner also compares the controls
between two iterations, which is where a process an iteration left behind would change one: with no park
between, a difference parks the run before the next iteration starts (no entry, the number not consumed); a
difference across a park — a person's edit, or a process's — is named on the next entry as
`controls_changed_between` and in the feed, and does not park the run again. A control changed between two
runner processes (after a `--no-park` exit, a spent budget, a stop) is not seen by the runner; `git status`
shows it, except under a `tools/` directory Git ignores. Outside a runner's iteration neither
control does anything: a person's `/drive` session edits a gate when a gate needs editing.

## The limits

- **Adopted repositories run on stated assumptions.** The Ground stage asks facts about the world, such
  as the release path of code the factory did not write. A fact is not a decision, so a row stays
  `unrecorded` and the bosun works on the survey's value as an assumption it names. The change-strategy ADR
  proceeds at `Proposed`; only a person writes `Accepted`. A person confirms or overturns both afterwards.
- **Facts are never invented.** See guarantee 3.
- **Flags stay off.** Under `release: flagged`, turning a flag on is never a decision the log can contain.
- **The constitution's MUSTs are the floor.** No decision waives one. A question whose every option breaks
  one goes to the bosun for the reading that keeps them all, and parks only if there is none.
- **The hand edits no code.** A defect it finds is a task. A fix there would make the verdict evidence for
  itself.
- **Unattended permissions need a sandbox.** The headless call runs with the permissions the registry row
  names for a normal run — edits accepted, the rest the harness's own to grant or refuse. Bypassing them all
  is allowed only with the runner's `--sandbox` flag, and the runner says why. Run an unattended loop inside
  a container or sandbox.
- **A run that loops is detected.** `stuck_after` iterations with the same artifact fingerprint give the
  bosun one iteration, then park the loop; the same open question raised twice in one iteration goes the
  same way.

The ladder `/cruise` runs, its stages, the models table and the benchmark are all described in
[The delivery loop](delivery-loop.md).
