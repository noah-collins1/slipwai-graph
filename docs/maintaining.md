# Work on the factory

The factory is held to the standard it generates. `make verify` here is the same kind of gate it writes
into every project: one command, run locally and in CI, that has to pass before a change is finished.

The version this repository carries, when to raise it, what a snapshot is and what a release tag means are in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#versioning-is-not-optional) — one rule, held to strictly, in one place.

## Verify it

```sh
make verify        # lint, typecheck, check-structure, test — the whole gate
make lint          # ruff over src/, scripts/ and tests/
make typecheck     # byte-compile, then mypy over the same three trees
make check-structure
make test          # the suite alone
make test TESTS="test_matrix test_add_service"   # a slice, by module
make test SKIP="test_matrix"                     # everything but
make test FULL=1                                 # every module, on a slice branch too
python3 -B scripts/select-tests.py --dry-run     # what a slice branch's `make test` would run, and why
FACTORY_BACKENDS=java-quarkus make test TESTS=test_matrix   # the matrix for one backend
```

On a `slice/<id>` branch `make test` calls `scripts/select-tests.py`, which runs the modules the change can reach and
names every one it skips and why; its first line says which base the change was measured against. Anywhere the
effect of a change cannot be established it runs every module and says in one line why: on any other branch, under
CI, for a change to `catalog.json`, `src/`, the `Makefile` or the selector itself, for a file git ignores. `SINCE`
names the base: it defaults to the trunk (`ci.branch` in `project.json`), and you set it, as `SINCE=<ref> make
test`, when your branch was cut from a branch other than the trunk and that branch's tip passed the full suite — the
run then takes that ref as passing on your word. In this repository that is `SINCE=adopt-method` until it merges
into `main`; a run that forgets it pays the full suite, never a narrower one. `FULL=1` runs every module whatever the
branch. `TESTS`, `SKIP` and `FACTORY_BACKENDS` turn selection off: the run is exactly what they ask for.
`make verify` always runs every module, whatever `SINCE` says. `--dry-run` prints the selection and runs nothing;
`--replay BASE..TIP`, with it, describes the change set of a range of commits instead of the working tree. A module
tells the selector what it reads by a literal `TEST_SELECTION = {"configurations": {"backend": ["go"]}, "reads":
["path"]}` at module level (`"configurations"` is an axis-to-options map or `"every"`; `"reads"` lists the files it
reads by path); a module without one always runs, and `tests/test_select_tests_declarations.py` holds each
declaration to the catalog and the tree. Until `s38.patch` is applied to the root `Makefile` (a person does that),
`make test` runs everything as before, and `python3 -B scripts/select-tests.py --dry-run` is how to see the selection.

CI runs those same targets as parallel jobs on the self-hosted runner, all starting at once: `checks` (lint,
typecheck, structure, every fast suite), `matrix (<backend>)` — one job per backend, each generating that
backend's variants and gating each with its native `make verify` — `add-service`, `migration`, and `aws`.
`.github/workflows/verify.yml` says how the slices divide; between them every test runs exactly once.

No job installs a toolchain. Every one of them needs all of them — any backend's project may be generated
and gated in any job — so they are baked into the job image built from
[`.github/runner/`](../.github/runner/README.md), and `.github/actions/toolchains` only checks that the
image provides the versions `.github/runner/versions.env` pins. Bumping one is an edit there plus a rebuild;
an image that was not rebuilt fails the first job of the next run by name. Locally the whole gate is still
`make verify`, against whatever toolchains the laptop has.

`make test-migration` is the one gate beside `verify`: it generates a project with the factory as it was at
the newest release tag, gives it work of its own, runs `slipwai migrate` from the factory as it is now, and
requires that the result is byte-identical to a fresh generation outside the project's
own files and green under its own `make verify`. Before the first public tag there is nothing to generate
from, so the gate exits 0. After that it needs the release tags, so a shallow clone cannot run it;
`MIGRATION_ARGS="--from v1.6.0"` starts from another revision, `--keep DIR` leaves the three trees to look
at. [Bring a generated project forward](upgrading.md) is the recipe it proves.

`make test-adoption` is the gate for brownfield adoption (experimental): each fixture repository under
`tests/fixtures/adopt/` — one per ecosystem the survey recognises, two in languages the factory cannot
generate — is made a repository with history of its own, adopted, re-surveyed as a no-op, held to
`make -f delivery/Makefile verify` where its toolchain is on the machine, migrated from a newer factory as one
clean merge that leaves the repository's own files untouched, and held to the gate again. `ADOPTION_ARGS="--only
go-module"` runs one fixture; `--keep DIR` leaves the adopted repositories to look at. CI runs it as its own job.

`scripts/containers/run` proves what the suite cannot — that `generate` and `adopt` leave a working project on a
machine that has nothing yet — in Docker, and needs the network. `bare-linux.sh` runs this checkout in
`debian:trixie` with only Python: git, make, Node and uv must be installed by slipwai itself, `./init` must finish,
CodeGraph must index without touching global agent config, and the generated project's own `make verify` must
pass. `macos-like.Dockerfile` is the Mac stand-in: Ubuntu with zsh and Oh My Zsh as the login shell, plus what a
stock Mac ships that Ubuntu does not — bash 3.2 as `/bin/sh` and `bash`, GNU Make 3.81, Apple's Python 3.9 — and
Homebrew; `macos-like.zsh` installs the wheel with `uv tool install` and runs the same journey through the
Homebrew routes (`SLIPWAI_HOST_SYSTEM=macos`). What it cannot be is Darwin: BSD `sed` and `tar`, `/opt/homebrew`
and Apple's protected paths still want a real Mac. `scripts/containers/run macos` or `linux` runs one half.

`make changelog` prints the commits since the last release, split by whether they reached a user, and the
fragments already written for the release `main` is working towards — the `1.3.0` a `VERSION` of
`1.3.0.dev0` is a snapshot of; `make changelog VERSION=1.2.0` lists from an older release. It writes
nothing — what an entry *says*, including what an already-generated repository must do to catch up, is the
author's.

**The entry in flight is [`changelog.d/`](../changelog.d), a file per change; [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)
is released prose only.** Write the fragment in the commit that makes the change, with its bump level on the
first line; `make release` assembles them into the entry, in the commit it tags, and deletes them. The
reason is what one shared entry did to a branch: two branches in flight both inserted at the top of the same
file, and `merge=union` in `.gitattributes` settled it without a conflict for Git while a forge — which
tests a pull request for conflicts with `git merge-file` in a bare repository, where no merge driver is
consulted — still reported one and asked somebody to resolve what Git had already merged. A file per change
has no shared line, in any tool. The level is checked rather than trusted: the highest one the fragments
claim, applied to the newest released entry, is the number `VERSION` has to carry, and
`tests/test_changelog.py` fails when it does not.

`make help` lists every target. The first run installs the pinned ruff and mypy from `requirements-dev.txt` into an
ignored `.python-tools`. A generated Python project is given uv and a committed `uv.lock` instead — this repository
has not moved, and that is the one place the two deliberately differ — but the *versions* are the same ones, and
`tests/test_factory_repository.py` holds them to it: the factory is not checked by a looser tool than the one it
hands its output.

The catalog (`catalog.json`) is the public configuration contract. `make test` validates its tier graph,
the default, the language matrix, and the indivisible Event Modeling/event-sourcing bundle. It scaffolds
disposable projects for every profile/language combination and runs each new repository's native
`make verify` gate — which is why the factory's own gate needs every supported backend toolchain present.

```

`scripts/check-structure.py` enforces that shape rather than leaving it to be described: imports point
inward through declared tiers, the graph stays acyclic, no module outgrows its line budget, and every
module says what part it is. It is the factory's own equivalent of the `check-imports.py` gate it ships to
generated projects, and `tests/test_factory_repository.py` proves it by handing it each violation it
exists to catch.

The tests mirror that split — one module per concern, with `tests/support.py` holding the
`FactoryTestCase` base that knows how to generate a project and how to expect a refusal.
`tests/test_maintenance_skills.py` holds the factory-maintenance skills in `.claude/skills/` to
the same standard as code: every path and test they cite has to resolve, every table keyed by
language has to be on both `add-language`'s and `add-framework`'s lists, and the generated gate's
target list they quote has to be the one `project/makefile.py` builds.
`tests/test_backend_obligations.py` pins the other direction: `docs/backend-obligations.md` is the
checklist those skills work from — every axis, every `make` target, every per-backend table — and that
suite derives each list from the catalog and the generator rather than trusting the file. Adding an axis
or a `make` target fails it until the document names the new obligation and every backend answers it,
which is the point: the failure list is the work the change created.

`tests/test_aws_stack.py` holds the production target to the real provider: it runs `tofu validate` over
every generated stack (skipping, with the reason, where `tofu` is not installed — the factory's CI installs
it and the pinned AWS provider once per run). `tests/test_images.py` builds every backend's image the way
`make build` does and starts it the way a task would, asking `/health` — the proof an image that builds and
pushes will also run; `pack` backends publish to a throwaway local registry, because Docker Desktop cannot
take a `pack` export directly. In CI it rides in each backend's `matrix` job, sliced by `FACTORY_BACKENDS`
like the matrix itself. `tests/test_launcher.py` proves the migrate task's entrypoint through the smallest
image the pinned builder makes, once, in the `aws` job. `docs/aws-target.md` says what that does and does
not prove.
`tests/test_aws_workflows.py` reads the two workflows that project is given — `deploy.yml` runs as a
`workflow_run` of `verify` on `main`, only when it passed, checking out the commit it passed; `rollback.yml`
is started by hand — and needs no tool, so it runs in the `checks` job.

`tests/test_matrix.py` is by far the slowest, being the one that generates every variant and runs its
native gate:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_catalog.py' -v   # one suite
```

## Decisions this factory cannot take back

`docs/adr/` holds the factory's own architecture decisions, in the shape the
[`architecture-decisions`](../assets/toolkit/skills/architecture-decisions/SKILL.md) skill asks of a generated
project: Nygard's five sections, one file per decision, numbered in order and never renumbered, and superseded
rather than edited once accepted. The test is the skill's — a decision is recorded when reversing it would cost
a migration rather than a refactor — and here that mostly means the shape of something a project persists:
a generated project's log, which is the one thing no version of this factory can migrate for it, and what an
adopted one records about the code that was already there.

- [`0001-a-dcb-capable-log.md`](adr/0001-a-dcb-capable-log.md) — the log records tags in a derived index, so a
  Dynamic Consistency Boundary stays available to a project that later wants one; stream-per-aggregate stays
  the default write path.
- [`0002-the-guard-a-slice-declares.md`](adr/0002-the-guard-a-slice-declares.md) — a state-change slice
  declares what its append is guarded by (`stream` or a tag `guard`), what it folds must be what that guard
  covers, and an event's identifying attributes are modelled while the tags derived from them are not.
  Completes the half `0001` recorded as owed.
- [`0003-a-wrapped-application-begins-as-a-candidate.md`](adr/0003-a-wrapped-application-begins-as-a-candidate.md)
  — the terminal asks only what a terminal can answer and the coding agent confirms the rest
  against the code; a buildable directory the survey finds is recorded as a candidate rather than a
  deployable, and `verify` refuses until somebody has confirmed one. Experimental with the rest of adoption
  (#74).

## Browse the starters

No starter copy is committed anywhere: `assets/toolkit/` and its overlays are the single source, so a
change there reaches every combination the moment it is generated. To inspect the current output of all
ten foundations, materialize them into the ignored `build/` directory:

```sh
make starters
```

That writes the exact output of `./slipwai generate` for each combination (minus `.git`) to
`build/starters/<profile>/<backend>/` — with the `none` frontend and the default answer on every axis, so a
browsed starter carries the Postgres store and the backend's transport that a default project gets, not a
bare skeleton.

## Regenerate the dependency locks

Each dependency set the axes can produce has its own committed lock, because npm, uv and Go all refuse a lock
that disagrees with its manifest. Rebuild them all, or check for staleness without changing anything:

```sh
make locks
make check-locks
```

This needs network access; nothing is downloaded into a `node_modules`, only the resolution is written down.

It also needs a current npm — the committed locks were produced by **npm 11.19.1**. npm 9 crashes in
arborist on these manifests, and an npm older than 11 writes no `license` field for a resolved package, so
regenerating with one rewrites every lock in the repository to say less than it did. Check `npm --version`
before believing a large diff from `make locks`.

`renovate.json` at the root is what moves those manifests in the first place. Every dependency this factory
pins — its own tooling, and the manifests under `assets/` that every generated project starts from — is pinned
exactly, so nothing ages them but a person. The configuration groups minor and patch updates per ecosystem
into a weekly pull request and holds every major on the dependency dashboard, because an asset's dependency
reaching a new major changes what every project generated afterwards is given and nobody is asked again.

Two things about it are worth knowing before reviewing one of its pull requests. **An npm bump under
`assets/` is half a change**: the committed locks have no `package.json` beside them — they are built per axis
combination — so `make check-locks` goes red until `make locks` has been run on the branch and the result
committed in the same pull request. That is the workflow, not a defect; a lock and its manifest have to be
produced together. And **what Renovate cannot see is written down in the file itself**: the per-feature npm
versions in `project/languages/typescript.py`, the build-tool pins in `images.py`, the toolchain versions in
`backends.py` and `.github/runner/versions.env` are Python source and an env file rather than manifests, and
they are bumped by hand — [what a backend owes](backend-obligations.md#4-choices-that-belong-to-the-ecosystem-and-to-the-user--not-to-this-repository)
says who owns each of those choices.

Nothing runs it by itself. This repository lives on a Gitea forge, so it needs a self-hosted Renovate run —
a scheduled workflow on the forge's own runner, or a cron job — with a token that may open pull requests; on
GitHub it would be the Renovate app installed on the repository instead. Until one of those exists the file
states an intent. Every generated project carries one of its own, for the same reason and with the same
caveat ([What you get](what-you-get.md#the-layout)).

factory-maintenance skills in `.claude/skills/` cover the three ways this factory grows:
`add-language` for a whole backend language, `add-framework` for a second framework beside one a
language already has, and `add-backing-service` for a tool choice — another answer to an existing
axis, or a new axis entirely.

`add-framework` is the one to reach for when the answer to "can we have Spring as well?" arrives.
The bare language name is reserved for a backend nothing owns the startup of, so how much that costs
depends on the existing key: beside an already-suffixed backend a sibling is purely additive, while
beside `typescript`, `python` or `go` it renames the existing backend too. `validate_backends`
enforces the naming in both directions either way.
