# Adversary log — 001-faster-slipwai

One row per finished slice, in the shape `delivery/commands/adversary.md` gives: the trigger table first, then what
was spawned or why nothing was, then the findings. A skip is a reported decision, never silence, and
`make -f delivery/Makefile check-decisions` holds every done slice to a row here.

## S00 · 2108b81 · 2026-10-03

Slice `S00-run-path`. The heading carries the id the checker reads — `check-decisions.py` and `benchmark.py` take a
slice's id as the `[A-Za-z]+\d+` prefix of the register row's first cell, so a slug after the number is not part of
it (D17; the factory fix rides in `S20`). Every later row here is headed the same way.

| Trigger | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| driving adapter (HTTP route, CLI command, queue consumer) | not present | `git diff --stat 5460bf9..2108b81`: no file under `src/slipwai/`, `assets/` or `scripts/` changed; the CLI (`./slipwai`, `scripts/agents/cruise.py`) is untouched — the slice ran `./slipwai --version` and recorded it (`delivery/survey/running.md`) |
| driven adapter or the provider types behind one | not present | the diff is five test files under `tests/` (the child environment a test hands `cruise.py`), a survey page, one `project.json` convergence row, the constitution's journey text, and the slice's own artifacts under `specs/` |
| authorisation decision (who can reach one that already exists) | not present | no authorisation exists in this tool and none was added |
| concurrency, idempotency, ordering, retention, or time | not present | the one behavioural change is in test fixtures (`outside_a_run()` in `tests/test_cruise_runner.py`), which makes no claim about any of these; `cruise.py start`'s refusal inside an iteration is unchanged and still proven by `tests/test_cruise_start.py:174` |

Not the slice that closes the feature's split (21 slices remain); `--full` not passed. **Skipped**: no trigger
`widened`; the slice's boundaries are the factory's own test tree and method records, and the external surface
(`./slipwai --version`) is the smoke command the gate already exercises (`tests/test_cli.py:17`).

Spawned: none
Omitted: none — no seam widened to omit
